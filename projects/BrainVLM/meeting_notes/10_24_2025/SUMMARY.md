## Part 1: Suin Cho's LLaVA-Style Experiments

### 1.1 Experimental Design

**Dataset:** ABCD (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development), N≈12,000
**Task:** Binary sex classification via text generation
**Input:** T1-weighted MRI images
**Metric:** Classification accuracy
**Objective:** Design optimal prompting strategies for neuroimaging VLM applications

**Architecture Configuration:**
- Patch Embedding: Trainable ✓
- Visual Encoder: Frozen ✓
- **Multi-modal Projector: Frozen ✗ (CRITICAL ISSUE)**
- Language Model: Frozen ✓

### 1.2 Experiment 1: Training QnA → Inference QnA (Format Consistency)

**Prompt Variations Tested:**

| Prompt Type | Description | Accuracy |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Default** | Simple neurologist role, direct question | **0.7869** |
| CoT (Chain-of-Thought) | Explicit anatomical features guidance | 0.7315 |
| Contrastive | Male vs female characteristic descriptions | 0.7580 |

**Key Findings:**
1. **Simple prompts outperform complex ones** - Default achieves best performance
2. **CoT decreases performance by 5.5%** - Surprising result suggesting:
   - Listed anatomical features (brain volume, gray/white ratio, ventricular size) may be wrong priors
   - Explicit feature guidance interferes with model's learned representations
   - Text instructions may distract from visual learning
3. **Contrastive prompting intermediate** - Helps but doesn't exceed simple approach

**Analysis:** The model performs best when given minimal instructions and allowed to learn discriminative features directly from data, rather than being guided by human neuroanatomical assumptions.

### 1.3 Experiment 2: Training Description → Inference QnA (Format Mismatch)

**Training Format:** Descriptive statements about brain characteristics
**Inference Format:** Direct question-answer

**Results:**

| Description Type | Training Answer | Accuracy | Status |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|--------|
| **Complex** | "The brain shows typical male characteristics including larger overall brain volume, lower gray-to-white matter ratio, increased ventricular size, and lower cortical thickness." | **0.6402** | **Near-random failure** |
| **Simple** | "The brain shows male characteristics." | 0.7405 | Reasonable performance |

**Critical Discovery - Template Memorization Problem:**

When training uses complex open-ended descriptions:
1. **Model memorizes deterministic templates** rather than learning visual features
2. **Visual encoder becomes weak** - can minimize loss through text pattern matching
3. **Inference collapse** - when forced to generate novel text at inference, weak visual features lead to random guessing

**Why Simple Descriptions Work:**
- No template to memorize
- Forces visual feature learning
- Short generation is stable
- Performance (0.7405) only ~6% below format-consistent baseline

### 1.4 Experiment 3: CoT + Description Format Mismatch

**Configuration:** CoT prompts during training with complex descriptions, QnA at inference

**Results:**

| Configuration | Accuracy | Analysis |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| CoT-Complex Description → QnA | 0.6142 | Worst performance - compounds both problems |
| CoT-Simple Description → QnA | 0.7387 | Recovers but still below simple default |

**Insight:** CoT instructions + complex descriptions create multiplicative failure:
- Long CoT instructions add complexity
- Complex answers enable template memorization
- Combination amplifies both problems
- Simple answers mitigate but don't eliminate CoT's negative impact

### 1.5 Architectural Bottleneck: Frozen Projector Analysis

**The Problem:**

The multi-modal projector serves as the bridge between vision and language embedding spaces. When frozen:

1. **Dimension Matching Without Semantic Alignment**
   - Projector ensures tensor dimensions are compatible
   - But brain MRI features map to arbitrary locations in language space

2. **Semantic Misalignment**
   - "Large brain volume" feature → random position in LM embedding space
   - Language model cannot interpret visual tokens meaningfully

3. **Weak Visual-Language Grounding**
   - Complex text: Model ignores weak visual signals, memorizes templates (0.64 accuracy)
   - Simple text: Forced to use whatever weak signals exist (0.74 accuracy)

**Impact:** Even the best performance (0.7869) likely represents a ceiling imposed by inadequate visual-language alignment. The frozen projector prevents the model from learning brain-specific visual-to-semantic mappings.

### 1.6 Suin Cho Experiments - Summary Table

| Training Format | Inference Format | Prompt Type | Accuracy | Key Insight |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| QnA | QnA | Default | **0.7869** | **Baseline - no format mismatch** |
| QnA | QnA | CoT | 0.7315 | CoT harms performance |
| QnA | QnA | Contrastive | 0.7580 | Moderate benefit from contrastive framing |
| Description | QnA | Complex | 0.6402 | Template memorization catastrophe |
| Description | QnA | Simple | 0.7405 | Format mismatch mitigated by simplicity |
| Description (CoT) | QnA | Complex | 0.6142 | Worst combination |
| Description (CoT) | QnA | Simple | 0.7387 | CoT still slightly harmful |

## Part 2: Janice's EVA-ViT Regression Experiments

### 2.1 Experimental Design

**Model:** EVA-ViT (vision encoder from EVA-CLIP: arXiv:2303.15389)
**Dataset:** GARD
**Tasks:**
- Age prediction (N=4,201)
- MMSE score prediction (N=1,905)

**Metric:** Test R² (coefficient of determination)
**Objective:** Compare pretrained vs scratch training, evaluate loss function effectiveness

**Training Strategies:**
- **Scratch:** Random initialization, train from zero
- **Pretrained:** EVA-CLIP pretrained weights (BLIP2 configuration)

**Loss Functions:**
- **MSE Loss:** Mean Squared Error (penalizes large errors heavily)
- **ABS Loss:** Mean Absolute Error (robust to outliers)

### 2.2 Age Prediction Results (N=4,201)

| Training Strategy | Loss Function | Test R² | Performance Assessment |
|------------------|---------------|---------|----------------------|
| **Pretrained** | **abs** | **0.1254** | **BEST - 6x better than scratch** |
| Scratch | abs | 0.021 | Poor performance |
| Pretrained | mse | **Exploded** | Training failure |
| Scratch | mse | -0.16802 | Worse than mean baseline |

**Optimal Configuration:** Pretrained + abs loss (lr=0.0001)

**Key Findings:**
1. **Pretraining Effect:** Dramatic 6x improvement (R²: 0.021 → 0.1254)
2. **Loss Function Specificity:**
   - abs loss (MAE) works for age prediction
   - mse loss completely fails (exploding gradients or negative R²)
3. **Validation Stability:** Pretrained model shows steady validation R² increase
4. **Performance Interpretation:** R²=0.1254 means 12.5% of age variance explained - moderate predictive power

**Why MSE Fails for Age:**
- Possible outliers in age distribution causing instability
- Age prediction may have heteroscedastic errors (variance changes with age)
- MAE's robustness to outliers critical for this task

### 2.3 MMSE Prediction Results (N=1,905)

| Training Strategy | Loss Function | Test R² | Performance Assessment |
|------------------|---------------|---------|----------------------|
| **Pretrained** | **mse** | **0.0183** | **BEST (only positive R²)** |
| Scratch | mse | -0.90166 | Catastrophic failure |
| Pretrained | abs | -0.0182 | Failed |
| Scratch | abs | -0.41037 | Failed |

**Optimal Configuration:** Pretrained + mse loss (lr=0.0001)

**Key Findings:**
1. **Pretraining Absolutely Essential:** Only pretrained + mse achieves positive R²
2. **Opposite Loss Pattern:** mse works, abs fails (inverse of age prediction)
3. **Extremely Low Performance:** R²=0.0183 = 1.8% variance explained (essentially no predictive power)
4. **Sample Size Critical:** Only 1,905 samples (45% of age dataset size)

**Why Performance is So Low:**
1. **Insufficient Training Data:** MMSE dataset half the size of Age dataset
2. **Task Complexity:** MMSE cognitive assessment may require features not captured by structural MRI
3. **Potential Non-linearity:** Relationship between brain structure and cognitive function may be highly complex

**Planned Mitigation:** Expand MMSE dataset to ~4,000 samples to match age dataset scale

### 2.4 Loss Function Task Specificity Analysis

**Divergent Behavior:**

| Task | Optimal Loss | Failed Loss | Hypothesis |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Age | abs (MAE) | mse (MSE) | Age has outliers or heteroscedastic errors |
| MMSE | mse (MSE) | abs (MAE) | MMSE requires squared error's sensitivity to deviations |

**Possible Explanations:**
1. **Outlier Distribution:** Age may have extreme outliers, MMSE may be more uniform
2. **Error Structure:** Different error distributional properties between tasks
3. **Optimization Landscape:** MSE creates different gradient flows than MAE
4. **Scale Sensitivity:** MSE penalizes large errors quadratically, affecting different tasks differently

**Recommendation:** Task-specific loss function tuning essential; consider hybrid losses (α×MSE + (1-α)×MAE)

### 2.5 Pretraining Impact Analysis

**Universal Finding: Scratch Training Fails**

| Dataset | Task | Best Scratch R² | Best Pretrained R² | Improvement |
|---------|------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| GARD | Age | 0.021 | 0.1254 | **6x** |
| GARD | MMSE | -0.90166 | 0.0183 | **∞ (only positive)** |

**Why Pretraining is Essential:**

1. **Natural Image Priors Transfer:** Despite domain gap (natural images → brain MRI), low-level features transfer:
   - Edge detection, texture analysis, spatial patterns
   - Compositional feature hierarchies

2. **Sample Efficiency:** Medical datasets are small; pretraining provides:
   - Better initialization
   - Regularization through learned representations
   - Faster convergence

3. **Representation Quality:** Pretrained encoders have learned:
   - Robust feature extractors
   - Effective embedding spaces
   - Hierarchical abstractions

4. **Domain Gap Bridging:** Even large distribution shift (RGB photos → grayscale MRI) preserves useful inductive biases

### 2.6 Computational Constraints

**UKB Model Bottleneck:**
- Training time: 1.5 hours per epoch (even with batch size=2)
- Resource limitation: Cannot complete locally
- **Solution:** Migration to KISTI supercomputing resources

**Future Plans:**
- Extended learning rate search: {0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001, 0.000001}
- Leverage KISTI for UKB pretrained model exploration
- Expand MMSE dataset to ~4,000 samples

## Part 3: Comparative Analysis of Vision Encoders

### 3.1 Architecture Overview - CRITICAL CLARIFICATION

**Vision Encoder Equivalence:**

🔑 **KEY ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHT**: BLIP-2's vision encoder IS EVA-CLIP, which is equivalent to EVA_ViT. Therefore, BLIP-2 and the EVA_ViT baseline share the same underlying vision encoder architecture.

**Two Vision Encoders in Experiments:**

1. **EVA-CLIP / EVA-ViT (Shared Backbone)**
   - ✓ Used by: Janice (EVA_ViT regression experiments)
   - ✓ Used by: BLIP-2 internal architecture
   - Vision encoder: EVA-ViT from EVA-CLIP paper (arXiv:2303.15389)
   - Pretraining: Large-scale vision-language data (CLIP-style)
   - Demonstrated by Janice: Age (R²=0.1254), MMSE (R²=0.0183)
   - Demonstrated by BLIP-2: Age (R²=0.1254), MMSE (R²=0.0183)

   **What This Means:**
   - BLIP-2 and EVA_ViT have **identical vision encoders**
   - Performance differences (if any) come from:
     - **Integration architecture**: How vision features connect to language
     - **Projector design**: BLIP-2's multi-modal projector (currently frozen)
     - **Training approach**: Different fine-tuning strategies
   - NOT from the vision encoder itself

2. **LLaVA-style Vision Encoder**
   - ✓ Used by: Suin Cho (classification experiments)
   - Architecture: ViT-L (different from EVA-CLIP)
   - Pretraining: Different vision-language foundation
   - Demonstrated: Sex classification (78.69% accuracy)
   - **Note**: Different vision encoder, so performance differences are confounded with both encoder AND integration strategy

### 3.2 Cross-Experiment Comparison Limitations

**Why Direct Comparison is Impossible:**

| Factor | Suin Cho Experiments | Janice Experiments |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Vision Encoder | LLaVA-style (ViT-L) | EVA-ViT (EVA-CLIP) |
| Task Type | Classification (binary) | Regression (continuous) |
| Dataset | ABCD (~12,000) | GARD (4,201 Age, 1,905 MMSE) |
| Metric | Accuracy (%) | R² coefficient |
| Approach | VLM with text generation | Direct vision regression |
| Training Paradigm | Prompt engineering focus | Loss function optimization |
| Target Variable | Biological sex | Age, cognitive score |

**Confounding Factors:**
- Different vision encoders (LLaVA vs EVA-CLIP)
- Different integration strategies (different projector designs)
- Different tasks have different difficulty levels
- Dataset size and quality vary
- Evaluation metrics aren't comparable (accuracy vs R²)
- Different architectural components frozen/trainable

### 3.3 What CAN Be Compared - With Architectural Clarification

**Universal Finding: Pretraining Effectiveness**

Both experiments independently confirm:
1. Pretrained models vastly outperform scratch training
2. Natural image pretraining transfers to brain MRI despite domain gap
3. Architectural choices (frozen components) significantly impact performance
4. Task-specific optimization required (prompts, loss functions, fine-tuning strategy)

**Key Insight from Architectural Equivalence:**

Since BLIP-2 and EVA_ViT share the same vision encoder (EVA-CLIP), their similar performance (R²=0.1254 for age, R²=0.0183 for MMSE) **cannot be attributed to encoder differences**. Instead:

- **BLIP-2 (with EVA-CLIP encoder) achieves R²=0.1254 for age** despite:
  - Frozen multi-modal projector (architectural bottleneck)
  - Vision-to-language integration overhead
  - LLM generation complexity

- **EVA_ViT (direct regression) achieves R²=0.1254 for age** with:
  - Direct linear regression head
  - No multi-modal projector overhead
  - Simpler training objective

**Critical Interpretation:** The fact that these identical vision encoders achieve identical performance means:
1. **The frozen projector is not the only bottleneck** - both systems hit performance ceiling
2. **Additional constraints** beyond frozen projector limit performance
3. **Unfreezing the projector may yield improvements** but may not be sufficient alone

**Performance Assessment by Vision Encoder:**

| Vision Encoder | Task | Performance | Model | Interpretation |
|--------|------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| EVA-CLIP/EVA_ViT | Sex classification | 78.69% accuracy | LLaVA-style | Moderate success on relatively easy task |
| EVA-CLIP/EVA_ViT | Age regression | R²=0.1254 | BLIP-2 & EVA_ViT | Weak but consistent predictive power |
| EVA-CLIP/EVA_ViT | MMSE regression | R²=0.0183 | BLIP-2 & EVA_ViT | Essentially no predictive power (data-limited) |

**Revised Conclusion:** Both EVA-CLIP-based systems show similar performance patterns, suggesting:
1. **Vision encoder is not the limiting factor** (both use EVA-CLIP)
2. **Integration architecture matters** (projector design, but frozen projector doesn't explain MMSE failure)
3. **Fundamental challenges** beyond architecture:
   - Domain gap between ImageNet pretraining and brain MRI
   - Task difficulty (especially MMSE with structural MRI only)
   - Data limitations (MMSE sample size only 1,905)
   - Possible non-linear relationships not captured by regression

## Part 7: Recommendations and Future Directions

### 7.1 Immediate Priority Actions - With Architectural Clarification

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHT:**
Now understanding that BLIP-2 uses EVA-CLIP (≡ EVA_ViT), the identical performance between BLIP-2 and EVA_ViT baseline means:

## Part 9: Actionable Next Steps (Prioritized)

## Conclusion

The BrainVLM experiments represent solid foundational work with clear identification of critical bottlenecks. Key achievements include systematic demonstration of pretraining necessity, discovery of the frozen projector limitation, and surprising findings about prompt simplicity.

However, absolute performance remains limited (Age R²=0.13, MMSE R²=0.02, Sex=78.69%), and critical architectural issues require immediate resolution. The research is at an inflection point: fixing the frozen projector and expanding datasets could yield substantial improvements, or may reveal more fundamental challenges in applying VLMs to neuroimaging.

**Primary Recommendation:** Execute the critical path (unfreeze projector, expand MMSE data) within 2 weeks and reassess. If performance improves substantially (Age R²>0.25, MMSE R²>0.10), proceed with full research program. If improvements are marginal, reconsider the VLM framework and explore alternative approaches.

**Strategic Insight:** The work may be inadvertently demonstrating that "vision-language" framing is premature for many neuroimaging tasks. Consider parallel development of streamlined vision-only models as a baseline, then rigorously evaluate when language components add value beyond architectural complexity.
