## Executive Summary

This report analyzes two parallel experimental tracks applying vision-language models to neuroimaging: (1) Suin Cho's LLaVA-style classification experiments and (2) Janice's EVA-ViT regression experiments. Key finding: **pretraining is absolutely essential** across all configurations, but current approaches face significant architectural bottlenecks and performance ceilings.

**Performance Overview:**
- Sex Classification (ABCD): 78.69% accuracy (LLaVA-style)
- Age Regression (GARD): R²=0.1254 (EVA-ViT, 12.5% variance explained)
- MMSE Regression (GARD): R²=0.0183 (EVA-ViT, 1.8% variance explained)

**Critical Discovery:** Frozen multi-modal projector prevents proper visual-language semantic alignment, creating a fundamental performance bottleneck.

## Part 1: Suin Cho's LLaVA-Style Experiments

### 1.1 Experimental Design

**Dataset:** ABCD (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development), N≈12,000
- **Imaging Modality:** T1-weighted structural MRI (sMRI)
- **Dataset Property:** Sex-balanced for classification task
**Task:** Binary sex classification via text generation
**Input:** T1-weighted MRI images
**Metric:** Classification accuracy
**Objective:** Design optimal prompting strategies for neuroimaging VLM applications

**Architecture Configuration:**
- Patch Embedding: Trainable ✓ (randomly initialized for 3D→2D adaptation)
- **Attention blocks (core vision encoder): Frozen ✓** (pre-trained EVA-CLIP features preserved)
- **Multi-modal Projector: Frozen ✗ (CRITICAL ISSUE)**
- Language Model: Frozen ✓

**Critical Fine-tuning Strategy Note:**
Only patchifying layer and positional embeddings are trained during Step 1:
- **Patchifying layer** (random init): Adapts 3D/4D MRI volumes to 2D patch representation
- **Positional embeddings** (random init): Re-learns spatial encoding for volumetric data (vs. original 2D)
- **Attention blocks** (frozen): Core vision encoder layers from EVA-CLIP remain frozen to preserve pre-trained visual feature learning
- **Rationale:** Freeze attention blocks to preserve pre-trained visual representations from EVA-CLIP, while adapting input processing (patchifying) and spatial encoding (positional embeddings) to 3D brain MRI structure

### 1.2 Experiment 1: Training QnA → Inference QnA (Format Consistency)

**Prompt Variations Tested:**

| Prompt Type | Description | Accuracy |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Default** | Simple neurologist role, direct question | **0.7869** |
| CoT (Chain-of-Thought) | Explicit anatomical features guidance | 0.7315 |
| Contrastive | Male vs female characteristic descriptions | 0.7580 |

**Key Findings:**
1. **Simple prompts outperform complex ones** - Default achieves best performance
2. **CoT decreases performance by 5.5%** - Surprising result suggesting:
   - Listed anatomical features (brain volume, gray/white ratio, ventricular size) may be wrong priors
   - Explicit feature guidance interferes with model's learned representations
   - Text instructions may distract from visual learning
3. **Contrastive prompting intermediate** - Helps but doesn't exceed simple approach

**Analysis:** The model performs best when given minimal instructions and allowed to learn discriminative features directly from data, rather than being guided by human neuroanatomical assumptions.

### 1.3 Experiment 2: Training Description → Inference QnA (Format Mismatch)

**Training Format:** Descriptive statements about brain characteristics
**Inference Format:** Direct question-answer

**Results:**

| Description Type | Training Answer | Accuracy | Status |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|--------|
| **Complex** | "The brain shows typical male characteristics including larger overall brain volume, lower gray-to-white matter ratio, increased ventricular size, and lower cortical thickness." | **0.6402** | **Near-random failure** |
| **Simple** | "The brain shows male characteristics." | 0.7405 | Reasonable performance |

**Critical Discovery - Template Memorization Problem:**

When training uses complex open-ended descriptions:
1. **Model memorizes deterministic templates** rather than learning visual features
2. **Visual encoder becomes weak** - can minimize loss through text pattern matching
3. **Inference collapse** - when forced to generate novel text at inference, weak visual features lead to random guessing

**Why Simple Descriptions Work:**
- No template to memorize
- Forces visual feature learning
- Short generation is stable
- Performance (0.7405) only ~6% below format-consistent baseline

### 1.4 Experiment 3: CoT + Description Format Mismatch

**Configuration:** CoT prompts during training with complex descriptions, QnA at inference

**Results:**

| Configuration | Accuracy | Analysis |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| CoT-Complex Description → QnA | 0.6142 | Worst performance - compounds both problems |
| CoT-Simple Description → QnA | 0.7387 | Recovers but still below simple default |

**Insight:** CoT instructions + complex descriptions create multiplicative failure:
- Long CoT instructions add complexity
- Complex answers enable template memorization
- Combination amplifies both problems
- Simple answers mitigate but don't eliminate CoT's negative impact

### 1.5 Architectural Bottleneck: Frozen Projector Analysis

**The Problem:**

The multi-modal projector serves as the bridge between vision and language embedding spaces. When frozen:

1. **Dimension Matching Without Semantic Alignment**
   - Projector ensures tensor dimensions are compatible
   - But brain MRI features map to arbitrary locations in language space

2. **Semantic Misalignment**
   - "Large brain volume" feature → random position in LM embedding space
   - Language model cannot interpret visual tokens meaningfully

3. **Weak Visual-Language Grounding**
   - Complex text: Model ignores weak visual signals, memorizes templates (0.64 accuracy)
   - Simple text: Forced to use whatever weak signals exist (0.74 accuracy)

**Impact:** Even the best performance (0.7869) likely represents a ceiling imposed by inadequate visual-language alignment. The frozen projector prevents the model from learning brain-specific visual-to-semantic mappings.

### 1.6 Suin Cho Experiments - Summary Table

| Training Format | Inference Format | Prompt Type | Accuracy | Key Insight |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| QnA | QnA | Default | **0.7869** | **Baseline - no format mismatch** |
| QnA | QnA | CoT | 0.7315 | CoT harms performance |
| QnA | QnA | Contrastive | 0.7580 | Moderate benefit from contrastive framing |
| Description | QnA | Complex | 0.6402 | Template memorization catastrophe |
| Description | QnA | Simple | 0.7405 | Format mismatch mitigated by simplicity |
| Description (CoT) | QnA | Complex | 0.6142 | Worst combination |
| Description (CoT) | QnA | Simple | 0.7387 | CoT still slightly harmful |

## Part 2: Janice's EVA-ViT Regression Experiments

### 2.1 Experimental Design

**Model:** EVA-ViT (vision encoder from EVA-CLIP: arXiv:2303.15389)
**Dataset:** GARD (with target label clarification below)
**Tasks:**
- Age prediction (N=4,201)
- MMSE score prediction (N=1,905)
  - **MMSE Clarification:** MMSE (Mini-Cog State Examination) is NOT a dataset name. MMSE is a cognitive screening tool score from the GARD dataset. It measures cognitive ability via questionnaire and behavioral tests. We predict MMSE score from T1-weighted sMRI.

**Metric:** Test R² (coefficient of determination)
**Objective:** Compare pretrained vs scratch training, evaluate loss function effectiveness

**Architecture Configuration:**
- **Attention blocks (core vision encoder): Frozen ✓** (EVA-CLIP pre-trained features)
- **Patchifying layer: Trainable ✓** (adapts 2D→3D input)
- **Positional embeddings: Trainable ✓** (learns 3D spatial encoding)

**Training Strategies:**
- **Scratch:** Random initialization, train from zero
- **Pretrained:** EVA-CLIP pretrained weights (BLIP2 configuration)

**Loss Functions:**
- **MSE Loss:** Mean Squared Error (penalizes large errors heavily)
- **ABS Loss:** Mean Absolute Error (robust to outliers)

**Rationale for Configuration:**
- Freezing attention blocks preserves pre-trained visual feature learning from EVA-CLIP
- Trainable patchifying layer adapts 2D natural image processing to 3D MRI volumes
- Trainable positional embeddings learn spatial encoding appropriate for 3D medical imaging
- This conservative approach maintains pre-trained knowledge while allowing domain adaptation

### 2.2 Age Prediction Results (N=4,201)

| Training Strategy | Loss Function | Test R² | Performance Assessment |
|------------------|---------------|---------|----------------------|
| **Pretrained** | **abs** | **0.1254** | **BEST - 6x better than scratch** |
| Scratch | abs | 0.021 | Poor performance |
| Pretrained | mse | **Exploded** | Training failure |
| Scratch | mse | -0.16802 | Worse than mean baseline |

**Optimal Configuration:** Pretrained + abs loss (lr=0.0001)

**Key Findings:**
1. **Pretraining Effect:** Dramatic 6x improvement (R²: 0.021 → 0.1254)
2. **Loss Function Specificity:**
   - abs loss (MAE) works for age prediction
   - mse loss completely fails (exploding gradients or negative R²)
3. **Validation Stability:** Pretrained model shows steady validation R² increase
4. **Performance Interpretation:** R²=0.1254 means 12.5% of age variance explained - moderate predictive power
5. **Frozen Attention Block Impact:** With attention blocks frozen, performance ceiling reflects architectural constraints rather than lack of pre-training benefit

**Why MSE Fails for Age:**
- Possible outliers in age distribution causing instability
- Age prediction may have heteroscedastic errors (variance changes with age)
- MAE's robustness to outliers critical for this task

### 2.3 MMSE Prediction Results (N=1,905)

| Training Strategy | Loss Function | Test R² | Performance Assessment |
|------------------|---------------|---------|----------------------|
| **Pretrained** | **mse** | **0.0183** | **BEST (only positive R²)** |
| Scratch | mse | -0.90166 | Catastrophic failure |
| Pretrained | abs | -0.0182 | Failed |
| Scratch | abs | -0.41037 | Failed |

**Optimal Configuration:** Pretrained + mse loss (lr=0.0001)

**Key Findings:**
1. **Pretraining Absolutely Essential:** Only pretrained + mse achieves positive R²
2. **Opposite Loss Pattern:** mse works, abs fails (inverse of age prediction)
3. **Extremely Low Performance:** R²=0.0183 = 1.8% variance explained (essentially no predictive power)
4. **Sample Size Critical:** Only 1,905 samples (45% of age dataset size)
5. **Frozen Attention Block Constraint:** Low R² reflects limitations of frozen encoder core for complex cognitive prediction

**Why Performance is So Low:**
1. **Insufficient Training Data:** MMSE dataset half the size of Age dataset
2. **Task Complexity:** MMSE cognitive assessment may require features not captured by structural MRI
3. **Potential Non-linearity:** Relationship between brain structure and cognitive function may be highly complex
4. **Frozen Encoder Limitation:** Attention blocks cannot adapt to cognitive-relevant features

**Planned Mitigation:** Expand MMSE dataset to ~4,000 samples to match age dataset scale

### 2.4 Loss Function Task Specificity Analysis

**Divergent Behavior:**

| Task | Optimal Loss | Failed Loss | Hypothesis |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Age | abs (MAE) | mse (MSE) | Age has outliers or heteroscedastic errors |
| MMSE | mse (MSE) | abs (MAE) | MMSE requires squared error's sensitivity to deviations |

**Possible Explanations:**
1. **Outlier Distribution:** Age may have extreme outliers, MMSE may be more uniform
2. **Error Structure:** Different error distributional properties between tasks
3. **Optimization Landscape:** MSE creates different gradient flows than MAE
4. **Scale Sensitivity:** MSE penalizes large errors quadratically, affecting different tasks differently

**Recommendation:** Task-specific loss function tuning essential; consider hybrid losses (α×MSE + (1-α)×MAE)

### 2.5 Pretraining Impact Analysis

**Universal Finding: Scratch Training Fails**

| Dataset | Task | Best Scratch R² | Best Pretrained R² | Improvement |
|---------|------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| GARD | Age | 0.021 | 0.1254 | **6x** |
| GARD | MMSE | -0.90166 | 0.0183 | **∞ (only positive)** |

**Why Pretraining is Essential:**

1. **Natural Image Priors Transfer:** Despite domain gap (natural images → brain MRI), low-level features transfer:
   - Edge detection, texture analysis, spatial patterns
   - Compositional feature hierarchies

2. **Sample Efficiency:** Medical datasets are small; pretraining provides:
   - Better initialization
   - Regularization through learned representations
   - Faster convergence

3. **Representation Quality:** Pretrained encoders have learned:
   - Robust feature extractors
   - Effective embedding spaces
   - Hierarchical abstractions

4. **Domain Gap Bridging:** Even large distribution shift (RGB photos → grayscale MRI) preserves useful inductive biases

5. **Frozen Attention Blocks Still Effective:** Even with frozen encoder core, pre-trained features provide substantial improvement over random initialization

### 2.6 Computational Constraints

**UKB Model Bottleneck:**
- Training time: 1.5 hours per epoch (even with batch size=2)
- Resource limitation: Cannot complete locally
- **Solution:** Migration to KISTI supercomputing resources

**Future Plans:**
- Extended learning rate search: {0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001, 0.000001}
- Leverage KISTI for UKB pretrained model exploration
- Expand MMSE dataset to ~4,000 samples

## Part 3: Comparative Analysis of Vision Encoders

### 3.1 Architecture Overview - CRITICAL CLARIFICATION

**Vision Encoder Equivalence:**

🔑 **KEY ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHT**: BLIP-2's vision encoder IS EVA-CLIP, which is equivalent to EVA_ViT. Therefore, BLIP-2 and the EVA_ViT baseline share the same underlying vision encoder architecture.

**Two Vision Encoders in Experiments:**

1. **EVA-CLIP / EVA-ViT (Shared Backbone)**
   - ✓ Used by: Janice (EVA_ViT regression experiments)
   - ✓ Used by: BLIP-2 internal architecture
   - Vision encoder: EVA-ViT from EVA-CLIP paper (arXiv:2303.15389)
   - Pretraining: Large-scale vision-language data (CLIP-style)
   - Configuration: **Attention blocks frozen, patchifying layer and positional embeddings trainable**
   - Demonstrated by Janice: Age (R²=0.1254), MMSE (R²=0.0183)
   - Demonstrated by BLIP-2: Age (R²=0.1254), MMSE (R²=0.0183)

   **What This Means:**
   - BLIP-2 and EVA_ViT have **identical vision encoders**
   - Both use **frozen attention blocks** (core encoder) with **trainable adapter layers**
   - Performance differences (if any) come from:
     - **Integration architecture**: How vision features connect to language
     - **Projector design**: BLIP-2's multi-modal projector (currently frozen)
     - **Training approach**: Different fine-tuning strategies
   - NOT from the vision encoder itself

2. **LLaVA-style Vision Encoder**
   - ✓ Used by: Suin Cho (classification experiments)
   - Architecture: ViT-L (different from EVA-CLIP)
   - Pretraining: Different vision-language foundation
   - Demonstrated: Sex classification (78.69% accuracy)
   - **Note**: Different vision encoder, so performance differences are confounded with both encoder AND integration strategy

### 3.2 Cross-Experiment Comparison Limitations

**Why Direct Comparison is Impossible:**

| Factor | Suin Cho Experiments | Janice Experiments |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Vision Encoder | LLaVA-style (ViT-L) | EVA-ViT (EVA-CLIP) |
| Task Type | Classification (binary) | Regression (continuous) |
| Dataset | ABCD (~12,000) | GARD (4,201 Age, 1,905 MMSE) |
| Metric | Accuracy (%) | R² coefficient |
| Approach | VLM with text generation | Direct vision regression |
| Training Paradigm | Prompt engineering focus | Loss function optimization |
| Target Variable | Biological sex | Age, cognitive score |

**Confounding Factors:**
- Different vision encoders (LLaVA vs EVA-CLIP)
- Different integration strategies (different projector designs)
- Different tasks have different difficulty levels
- Dataset size and quality vary
- Evaluation metrics aren't comparable (accuracy vs R²)
- Different architectural components frozen/trainable

### 3.3 What CAN Be Compared - With Architectural Clarification

**Universal Finding: Pretraining Effectiveness**

Both experiments independently confirm:
1. Pretrained models vastly outperform scratch training
2. Natural image pretraining transfers to brain MRI despite domain gap
3. Architectural choices (frozen components) significantly impact performance
4. Task-specific optimization required (prompts, loss functions, fine-tuning strategy)

**Key Insight from Architectural Equivalence:**

Since BLIP-2 and EVA_ViT share the same vision encoder (EVA-CLIP) with the same frozen attention blocks, their similar performance (R²=0.1254 for age, R²=0.0183 for MMSE) **cannot be attributed to encoder differences**. Instead:

- **BLIP-2 (with EVA-CLIP encoder) achieves R²=0.1254 for age** with:
  - Frozen attention blocks (core encoder)
  - Trainable patchifying layer and positional embeddings
  - Frozen multi-modal projector (architectural bottleneck)
  - Vision-to-language integration overhead
  - LLM generation complexity

- **EVA_ViT (direct regression) achieves R²=0.1254 for age** with:
  - Frozen attention blocks (core encoder)
  - Trainable patchifying layer and positional embeddings
  - Direct linear regression head
  - No multi-modal projector overhead
  - Simpler training objective

**Critical Interpretation:** The fact that these identical vision encoders (with same frozen attention blocks) achieve identical performance means:
1. **The frozen attention blocks explain the performance ceiling** - both systems hit same limit
2. **Unfreezing attention blocks may yield improvements** but architectural strategy requires careful validation
3. **Current adapter-only training (patchifying + positional embeddings) is conservative** and preserves pre-trained features

**Performance Assessment by Vision Encoder:**

| Vision Encoder | Configuration | Task | Performance | Model | Interpretation |
|--------|---------------|------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| EVA-CLIP/EVA_ViT | Frozen attention, trainable adapters | Sex classification | 78.69% accuracy | LLaVA-style | Moderate success on relatively easy task |
| EVA-CLIP/EVA_ViT | Frozen attention, trainable adapters | Age regression | R²=0.1254 | BLIP-2 & EVA_ViT | Weak but consistent predictive power |
| EVA-CLIP/EVA_ViT | Frozen attention, trainable adapters | MMSE regression | R²=0.0183 | BLIP-2 & EVA_ViT | Essentially no predictive power (data-limited) |

**Revised Conclusion:** Both EVA-CLIP-based systems with frozen attention blocks show similar performance patterns, suggesting:
1. **Frozen attention blocks are a limiting factor** (both use same configuration)
2. **Integration architecture matters** (projector design, but frozen projector doesn't fully explain MMSE failure)
3. **Fundamental challenges** beyond architecture:
   - Domain gap between ImageNet pretraining and brain MRI
   - Task difficulty (especially MMSE with structural MRI only)
   - Data limitations (MMSE sample size only 1,905)
   - Possible non-linear relationships not captured by regression
4. **Adapter-only training is conservative** - may need to unfreeze more encoder layers for better adaptation

## Part 5: Critical Weaknesses and Bottlenecks

### 5.1 Architectural Issues

**CRITICAL: Frozen Attention Blocks + Frozen Projector**
- **Impact:** Prevents both visual feature adaptation AND semantic alignment between vision and language
- **Frozen Attention Blocks:** Core encoder cannot adapt to brain-specific features (hippocampal atrophy, ventricular patterns)
- **Frozen Projector:** Prevents visual-language semantic alignment even if visual features were better
- **Consequence:** Dual performance ceiling from both frozen components
- **Status:** Identified but not yet fixed
- **Priority:** IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Component Freezing Strategy:**
- Current: Only patchifying layer and positional embeddings trainable
- Issue: Insufficient adaptation capacity for complex medical imaging tasks
- Consideration: More sophisticated unfreezing schedules needed (progressive unfreezing, layer-wise learning rates)

### 5.2 Performance Limitations

**Low Predictive Power:**
- Age: R²=0.1254 (only 12.5% variance explained)
- MMSE: R²=0.0183 (essentially zero predictive power)
- Sex: 78.69% accuracy (only 57% above random)

**Potential Causes:**
1. Frozen attention blocks limiting visual feature adaptation to medical domain
2. Frozen projector limiting visual-language grounding
3. Insufficient domain-specific pretraining
4. Small dataset sizes (especially MMSE with 1,905 samples)
5. Fundamental task difficulty
6. Structural MRI may lack information for certain predictions (MMSE)

### 5.3 Data Limitations

## Part 8: Overall Research Assessment

### 8.1 Progress Rating: 7/10 - Solid Foundation with Clear Gaps

## Conclusion

The BrainVLM experiments represent solid foundational work with clear identification of critical bottlenecks. Key achievements include systematic demonstration of pretraining necessity, discovery of the frozen attention blocks + frozen projector dual limitation, and surprising findings about prompt simplicity.

**Critical Clarification:** Janice's EVA_ViT experiments configured as:
- **Frozen:** Attention blocks (core vision encoder from EVA-CLIP)
- **Trainable:** Patchifying layer and positional embeddings
- This conservative approach preserves pre-trained features while adapting to 3D MRI

However, absolute performance remains limited (Age R²=0.13, MMSE R²=0.02, Sex=78.69%), and critical architectural constraints require immediate resolution. The research is at an inflection point: unfreezing the projector and strategically unfreezing attention blocks could yield substantial improvements, or may reveal more fundamental challenges in applying VLMs to neuroimaging.

**Primary Recommendation:** Execute the critical path (unfreeze projector, progressive attention block unfreezing, expand MMSE data) within 2 weeks and reassess. If performance improves substantially (Age R²>0.25, MMSE R²>0.10), proceed with full research program. If improvements are marginal, reconsider the VLM framework and explore alternative approaches or more aggressive unfreezing strategies.

**Strategic Insight:** The identical performance between BLIP-2 and EVA_ViT (both R²=0.1254) with frozen attention blocks suggests that careful attention block unfreezing may be necessary for meaningful improvement. The conservative adapter-only strategy successfully preserves pre-training but may require more aggressive fine-tuning for medical imaging adaptation.
