## 🎯 The 3 Most Important Things

### 1. Current Performance vs. Target
```
SwiFT v2 Now:    70-73%  (Efficient)
Brain-JEPA:      76-78%  (SOTA)
Gap:             2-3%    (Addressable)
Target:          75-76%  (With 3 improvements)
Timeline:        3-4 months
```

### 2. The Improvement Path (Priority Order)
```
#1: JEPA-style pretraining    → +2-3% accuracy
#2: Spatiotemporal masking    → +1-2% accuracy
#3: Physiological signals     → +0.5-1% accuracy
────────────────────────────────────────────
    Total impact:             70-73% → 75-76%
```

### 3. Publication Status
```
Introduction:    ✅ PUBLICATION-READY (2,200 words)
Strategic Plan:  ✅ COMPLETE (9 directions, 12 months)
Competitive Pos: ✅ DEFINED (efficient baseline, research platform)
Next:            Gather citations, outline methods section
```
