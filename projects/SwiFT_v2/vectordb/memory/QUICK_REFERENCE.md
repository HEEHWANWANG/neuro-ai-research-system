## 💡 Critical Insights (Read These First)

### **Insight #1: JEPA is Superior**
- Representation-level prediction beats pixel reconstruction for noisy fMRI
- Gap: 2-3% accuracy improvement
- Why: fMRI noise (SNR 0.5-1.0) makes pixel targets unstable
- Action: Implement JEPA-style pretraining first

### **Insight #2: Diversity Matters More Than Scale**
- Multi-cohort (mixed sources) > single-source (massive scale)
- SwiFT v2's strength: 100K+ subjects from 3 diverse datasets
- Strategic curation > raw quantity
- Action: Leverage this advantage in positioning

### **Insight #3: Temporal Dynamics Unexplored**
- BOLD has 2-3 second autocorrelation
- Current: Random masking (ignores temporal structure)
- Opportunity: Spatiotemporal masking strategies
- Gain: +1-2% accuracy with low effort

### **Insight #4: Path to Competitive Performance Exists**
- Need 3 changes: JEPA (+2-3%), Temporal (+1-2%), Physio (+0.5-1%)
- Total: 70-73% → 75-76% (Brain-JEPA range)
- Timeline: 3-4 months feasible
- Effort: Moderate overall

### **Insight #5: Clinical Deployment Has Separate Challenge**
- Current approaches: 70-78% accuracy
- Clinical requirement: ~85% accuracy
- Gap isn't just accuracy—also uncertainty quantification & interpretability
- Action: Clinical validation work (separate track)

## ❓ Quick FAQ

**Q: Is SwiFT v2 competitive with Brain-JEPA?**
A: Currently 2-3% behind, but addressable with 3 specific improvements (JEPA-style training, temporal masking, physiological signals). Achievable in 3-4 months.

**Q: Which improvement should we do first?**
A: JEPA-style pretraining. It gives +2-3% accuracy and addresses fundamental fMRI characteristic (noise level). Do this first.

**Q: Is SwiFT v2 ready for publication?**
A: Introduction is publication-ready. Methods and results sections still need work. Timeline for full paper: 2-3 months with implementation work.

**Q: What makes SwiFT v2 unique?**
A: (1) Computational efficiency—3-5 days on 8-16 GPUs; (2) Multi-cohort diversity strategy; (3) Architectural modularity for testing improvements; (4) Interpretable reconstruction targets.

**Q: Should we pursue clinical deployment?**
A: Not as primary path. Current 70-78% accuracy insufficient for clinical deployment (~85% required). Make this separate workstream. Focus on research excellence first.
