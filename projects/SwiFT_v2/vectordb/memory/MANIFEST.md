## 🔑 The 5 Critical Findings

1. **Brain-JEPA Superior** → Representation-level learning beats pixel reconstruction by 2-3%
2. **Diversity > Scale** → Multi-cohort better than single-source massive scale
3. **Temporal Unexplored** → BOLD autocorrelation (2-3s) underexploited
4. **Clear Path Forward** → SwiFT v2 can reach 75-76% in 3-4 months
5. **Clinical Gap Exists** → Need 85% for deployment (current ~70-78%)

---

## 🚀 The 3-Pronged Improvement Path

```
Timeline: 3-4 months to competitive performance (75-76%)

1. JEAP-Style Pretraining
   ├─ Effort: Moderate
   ├─ Gain: +2-3% accuracy
   └─ Outcome: 72-76% range

2. Spatiotemporal Masking
   ├─ Effort: Low-Moderate
   ├─ Gain: +1-2% accuracy
   └─ Outcome: Temporal coherence optimization

3. Physiological Signals
   ├─ Effort: Moderate
   ├─ Gain: +0.5-1% accuracy
   └─ Outcome: Multimodal alignment with BrainLM

Combined: 70-73% → 75-76% (Brain-JEPA competitive range)
