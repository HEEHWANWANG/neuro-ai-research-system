## Key Findings Summary

### Competitive Landscape
```
Brain-JEPA:    76-78% downstream accuracy (state-of-the-art)
BrainLM:       73-75% (comprehensive, mature)
SwiFT v2:      70-73% (efficient baseline)
```

### Critical Insight
Representation-level predictive learning (JEPA) outperforms pixel-level reconstruction (MAE/SimMIM) by 2-3% on fMRI due to noise characteristics (SNR 0.5-1.0).

### Strategic Assessment
SwiFT v2 positioned as **efficient baseline + research platform**, not state-of-the-art. Clear path to competitive performance (→ 75-76%) via JEPA + spatiotemporal masking + physiological signals.

## How to Resume This Work (Next Session)

### Retrieve Research Context
1. Use Serena memory system to load research findings:
   ```
   read_memory("SwiFT_v2_Competitive_Analysis_Complete")
   read_memory("SwiFT_v2_Strategic_Roadmap_2025")
   read_memory("SwiFT_v2_Publication_Introduction_Final")
   ```

2. Access full documents from workspace:
   ```
   /Users/apple/Desktop/neuro-ai-research-system/.claude/workspace/
   ```

### Next Immediate Actions

## Key Learnings & Insights

### About fMRI Foundation Models
1. **Pretraining objective matters most** - JEPA > MAE by 2-3% for fMRI
2. **Data diversity > scale** - Multi-cohort beats single 40K-hour source
3. **Temporal dynamics critical** - BOLD autocorrelation (2-3s) carries information
4. **Architectural saturation near 800M** - Diminishing returns beyond this scale
5. **Clinical gap remains** - 78% research-grade insufficient for deployment (~85% needed)

### About SwiFT v2
1. **Strong efficiency positioning** - Best accuracy-per-compute ratio
2. **Modular architecture** - Easy to test improvements (JEPA, masking)
3. **Multi-dataset strategy novel** - Diversity approach differentiates from competitors
4. **Clear improvement pathway** - 3-4 months to competitive performance feasible
5. **Research platform value** - Enables incremental improvements, not final system

### About Competitive Landscape
1. **Brain-JEPA leading** - 76-78% accuracy with theoretically superior approach
2. **BrainLM mature** - Comprehensive system but expensive (6-20 days, 64 GPUs)
3. **No clear winner** - Different models optimal for different constraints
4. **Open questions remain** - Architecture optimality, temporal modeling, clinical translation
