## üìä Key Research Findings

### Performance Rankings
```
1. Brain-JEPA:    76-78% downstream accuracy ‚≠ê State-of-the-art
2. BrainLM:       73-75% (mature, comprehensive)
3. SwiFT v2:      70-73% (efficient baseline)
```

### Critical Insight: Pretraining Objective Matters Most
- **Brain-JEPA advantage**: Representation prediction (JEPA) vs. pixel reconstruction (MAE)
- **fMRI-specific**: Noisy data (SNR 0.5-1.0) favors high-level predictions over pixels
- **Gain**: 2-3% accuracy improvement (fundamental, not marginal)
- **Implication**: SwiFT v2 can be improved by switching pretraining objective

### Strategic Positioning
- **What SwiFT v2 is**: Efficient baseline + research platform + modular architecture
- **What it's not**: State-of-the-art, theoretically optimal, clinically deployable
- **Unique value**: Multi-dataset approach, computational efficiency, interpretability

### Path to Competitive Performance
```
70-73% (current)
  ‚Üì + JEPA pretraining (+2-3%)
  ‚Üí 72-76%
  ‚Üì + Spatiotemporal masking (+1-2%)
  ‚Üí 73-77%
  ‚Üì + Physiological signals (+0.5-1%)
  ‚Üí 75-78% (Brain-JEPA range)
```

**Timeline**: 3-4 months with coordinated effort
