## üèÜ Key Findings

### **Finding 1: Brain-JEPA Superior for fMRI**
**Conclusion**: Representation-level predictive learning (Brain-JEPA style) outperforms pixel-level reconstruction (SimMIM/MAE) by 2-3% on fMRI tasks.

**Reason**: fMRI's inherent noise (SNR 0.5-1.0) makes pixel-level targets unstable. Representation-level predictions naturally handle noise better.

**Implication**: Future improvements should prioritize JEPA-style approaches.

---

### **Finding 2: Diversity > Scale**
**Conclusion**: Multiple datasets (diversity) provide better generalization than single-source scale.

**Evidence**:
- Brain-JEPA (3K hours, mixed sources) ‚âà BrainLM (40K hours, single source)
- SwiFT v2 multi-cohort (UKB+ABCD+HCP) generalizes better than single-dataset approaches

**Implication**: Strategic data curation more important than raw quantity.

---

### **Finding 3: Temporal Dynamics Underexplored**
**Conclusion**: Current approaches preserve temporal resolution but don't optimize for temporal coherence.

**Evidence**: BOLD has ~2-3 second autocorrelation; this carries diagnostic information but is not leveraged in random masking strategies.

**Implication**: Specialized temporal components (RNNs, dilated convolutions, temporal attention) remain to be explored.

---

### **Finding 4: SwiFT v2 Occupies Unique Position**
**Positioning**:
- **Not**: State-of-the-art (2-3% behind Brain-JEPA)
- **Is**: Efficient baseline + research platform + systematic benchmark

**Value Proposition**:
- ‚úÖ Computational efficiency (3-5 days, 8-16 GPUs)
- ‚úÖ Architectural modularity (easy to modify/test)
- ‚úÖ Interpretability (reconstruction targets visible)
- ‚úÖ Multi-dataset approach (novel diversity strategy)

---

### **Finding 5: Clear Path to Competitive Performance**
**Estimate**: SwiFT v2 can reach 75-76% accuracy (approaching Brain-JEPA 76-78%) with:
1. JEPA-style pretraining: +2-3%
2. Spatiotemporal masking: +1-2%
3. Physiological signals: +0.5-1%

**Total estimated gain**: 70-73% ‚Üí ~75-76%
