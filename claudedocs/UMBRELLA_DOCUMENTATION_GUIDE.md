## Glossary

**UMBRELLA:** Code name for the project. Vision: transform neuroimaging into medical report generation via text generation framework.

**Stage 1:** EVA_ViT experiments validating vision encoder adaptation to MRI.

**Stage 2:** BLIP-2/LLaVA experiments validating VLM + MRI text generation.

**Stage 3:** Output parsing methodology bridging generative models to traditional metrics.

**Step 1 Training:** Train patchifying layer only (freeze vision + text encoders).

**Step 2 Training:** Fine-tune vision encoder + projector (preserve ImageNet >95%).

**Caption Engineering:** Using structured data (demographics, brain metrics) as "captions" to teach model MRI interpretation.

**Output Parsing:** Converting generated text to numerical values for traditional metric computation (R², accuracy).
