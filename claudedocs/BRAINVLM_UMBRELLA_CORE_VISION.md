# BrainVLM UMBRELLA: Core Vision Document
**Project Code Name:** UMBRELLA (Universal Framework for Multimodal Brain Representation Learning by Embedding Large Language Models for Neuroimaging Analysis)

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** Foundational Vision Document

---

## Executive Summary

BrainVLM (UMBRELLA) represents a **paradigm shift** in neuroimaging analysis - transforming traditional prediction tasks into a **text generation framework** that enables medical report generation from multi-modal MRI data. This is not merely a classification/regression system; it's a foundation for integrating neuroimaging into modern AI agent systems (CoT, ReACT, RAG, Multi-Agent).

**Core Innovation**: By converting neuroimaging → text generation, we bridge neuroscience and the language-centric AI revolution, enabling MRI scans to participate in agentic AI workflows.

---

## The UMBRELLA Paradigm

### From Prediction to Text Generation

**Traditional Approach**:
```
MRI Image → CNN/ViT → Regression Head → Scalar Prediction (age=45, MMSE=28)
```

**UMBRELLA Approach**:
```
Multi-modal MRI → Universal Encoder → LLM → Medical Report Generation
"This 66 years-old male subject shows typical brain characteristics
with moderate intelligence score. Based on structural and functional
analysis, MCI diagnosis is likely..."
```

**Inspiration**: Google T5 paper demonstrated that classification, regression, and detection can all be reformulated as text generation tasks.

---

## Three-Fold Novel Contributions

### 1. Multi-modal MRI Understanding via Text Generation Framework

**What This Means**:
- All prediction tasks (age, sex, cognitive scores, disease diagnosis) become text generation
- Unified framework handles diverse neuroimaging tasks
- Enables complex reasoning beyond simple predictions

**Example Transformations**:
```
Classification Task:
Input: "Predict sex from MRI"
Traditional Output: [0.89, 0.11] → "Female"
UMBRELLA Output: "The brain shows typical female characteristics including
higher cortical thickness and different white matter patterns."

Regression Task:
Input: "Estimate age from brain structure"
Traditional Output: 45.3 years
UMBRELLA Output: "This subject is approximately 45 years old based on
ventricular expansion and cortical thinning patterns."

Complex Analysis:
Input: "Analyze cognitive status"
Traditional: MMSE=28 (number only)
UMBRELLA: "Based on structural MRI showing mild hippocampal atrophy and
fMRI connectivity patterns, this 66-year-old male shows signs consistent
with early MCI. Intelligence score appears below average."
```

### 2. Prompt Design for Proper Model Training

**Critical Innovation**: The way we ask questions to the model fundamentally shapes what it learns.

**Prompt Engineering Strategy**:
```python
# Question 1: Multi-modal Analysis
"You are a neurologist analyzing fMRI, sMRI, and dMRI.
Analyze the image and estimate age, sex, and intelligence
score of subject from this image."

# Question 2: Clinical Reasoning
"Based on the above estimation, explain the cognitive ability
of this subject and estimate whether this subject will be
diagnosed with MCI."
```

**Why Prompts Matter**:
- Guides model to learn clinically relevant features
- Structures output in medically meaningful ways
- Enables chain-of-thought reasoning
- Facilitates integration with medical knowledge

**From Current Experiments** (Suin Cho's findings):
- Simple prompts outperform complex ones (78.69% vs 73.15%)
- Template memorization is a critical failure mode
- Prompt design directly impacts visual feature learning quality

### 3. Caption Engineering: The "We Don't Know How to Describe MRI" Solution

**The Fundamental Problem**:
Unlike natural images ("a dog playing in a park"), we don't have natural language descriptions of brain MRI scans. How do you caption a brain?

**UMBRELLA's Breakthrough Solution**: Information Injection via "Captions"

**Caption Engineering Strategy**:
```
Demographics as Captions:
"74.8-year-old Female with 19 years of education.
The MMSE score is 29. The CDR score is 0.5.
The logical memory score is 9."

Brain Metrics as Captions:
"Total brain volume: 1,234 cm³
Hippocampal volume: 3.2 cm³ (left), 3.1 cm³ (right)
Cortical thickness: 2.4mm average
White matter hyperintensities: Grade 2"

Functional Metrics as Captions:
"Default mode network connectivity: 0.45
Frontoparietal network: 0.38
Salience network: 0.52"

Clinical Information as Captions:
"Medical history: Hypertension, Type 2 Diabetes
Current medications: Metformin, Lisinopril
Cognitive complaints: Mild memory difficulties"
```

**How This Solves the Problem**:
1. **Transforms structured data → natural language**: All available information becomes text the LLM can understand
2. **Overcomes description barrier**: We don't describe what brain looks like; we describe what we know about the brain
3. **Multimodal integration**: Demographics + brain metrics + clinical data all become unified text captions
4. **Training signal**: Model learns to connect visual MRI patterns with comprehensive textual descriptions

**Caption Strategy from Presentation (Slide 12)**:
- bloodmarker → text table
- proteomics → text table
- microbiome → text table
- digital phenotype → text table
- assessment/questionnaire → text table

**Result**: "Text as the universal interface" - LLMs can easily understand structured tables, eliminating need for separate modality encoders.

## Two-Step Training Strategy

### Training Philosophy

**Goal**: Adapt natural image-language models to brain MRI domain while preserving their powerful language-grounded representations.

**Critical Constraint**: We CANNOT afford to lose performance on natural image-language tasks. The vision encoder's pre-trained knowledge is valuable.

### Step 1: Train Patchifying Layer (Freeze Vision + Text Encoders)

**What**: Adapt 3D/4D MRI data to natural image space

**Freeze**:
- Vision encoder (EVA-CLIP, CLIP ViT)
- Text encoder (LLM)
- Multi-modal projector (Q-Former for BLIP-2, or projection layers for LLaVA)

**Trainable**:
- **Patchifying layer only** - converts 3D/4D MRI → 2D patches compatible with vision encoder

**Why This Works**:
- MRI patchifying learns: "How to represent 3D brain structure as 2D-like features"
- Vision encoder sees brain patches as if they were natural image patches
- Leverages pre-trained vision knowledge without modification
- Low risk of catastrophic forgetting

**Technical Details**:
```
T1-weighted MRI: 128×128×128 voxels
  ↓
Patchify: 18×18×18 voxel patches → flatten → project to 2D
  ↓
Vision Encoder Input: Treats as 2D image patches
  ↓
Frozen Vision Encoder: Extracts features using ImageNet knowledge
  ↓
Frozen Projector: Maps to language space
  ↓
Frozen LLM: Generates text
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- Basic adaptation to brain MRI
- Reasonable performance on simple tasks (sex, age)
- Foundation for Step 2

### Step 2: Train Patchifying + Vision Encoders Together

**What**: Adapt vision encoder to MRI-specific features while maintaining natural image-language alignment

**Freeze**:
- Text encoder (LLM) - preserve language generation capability
- (Optional) Multi-modal projector - depends on performance

**Trainable**:
- Patchifying layer (continues adaptation)
- **Vision encoder** (fine-tunes to brain-specific features)

**PRIMARY GOAL**: No performance drop on natural image-language tasks

**Why This Is Critical**:
- Vision encoder learned powerful semantic representations from billions of image-text pairs
- We want brain-specific features BUT not at cost of losing general visual understanding
- Maintaining natural image performance ensures model can still:
  - Understand visual concepts
  - Ground language in visual semantics
  - Generalize to new domains

**How to Achieve No Performance Drop**:
1. **Multi-task learning**: Train on brain MRI AND natural images simultaneously
2. **Regularization**: Penalize drift from pre-trained weights
3. **Careful learning rates**: Very small LR for vision encoder (e.g., 1e-6 vs 1e-4 for patchifying)
4. **Validation**: Continuously test on natural image benchmarks (COCO, ImageNet)
5. **Early stopping**: If natural image performance drops >5%, revert or adjust

**Expected Outcome**:
- Vision encoder learns brain-specific features (hippocampal atrophy, ventricular expansion)
- Maintains natural image understanding
- Best of both worlds: medical expertise + general visual intelligence

**From Current Experiments**:
- Step 1 equivalent: Patch embedding trainable, rest frozen → R²=0.1254 (age), R²=0.0183 (MMSE)
- Step 2 not yet tested: Unfreezing vision encoder expected to improve significantly

## How Current Experiments Fit Into UMBRELLA Vision

### Current State: Early-Stage Exploration

**What We've Done So Far**:
1. **Suin Cho's LLaVA experiments** (ABCD, sex classification):
   - Testing prompt design strategies
   - Discovering template memorization problem
   - Finding simple prompts work best
   - **Achievement**: 78.69% accuracy
   - **Status**: Step 1 of training strategy (frozen vision encoder)

2. **Janice's EVA-ViT experiments** (GARD, age/MMSE regression):
   - Testing different vision encoders
   - Exploring loss functions
   - Demonstrating pretraining necessity
   - **Achievement**: Age R²=0.1254, MMSE R²=0.0183
   - **Status**: Regression baseline (not yet text generation)

**Critical Insight from Analysis**:
- BLIP-2 uses EVA-CLIP vision encoder
- EVA_ViT baseline uses same encoder
- **Identical performance** (R²=0.1254) reveals:
  - Vision encoder is NOT the bottleneck
  - Frozen projector limits BLIP-2 specifically
  - Multiple constraints exist beyond architecture

### How Experiments Are Stepping Stones to UMBRELLA

#### Stepping Stone 1: Prompt Design (Suin Cho)
```
Current: Sex classification with prompts → 78.69% accuracy
  ↓
UMBRELLA: "This brain shows typical male characteristics..."
  ↓
Future: Full medical report generation
```

**Lessons Learned**:
- Simple prompts > complex prompts
- Template memorization is dangerous
- Format consistency matters (QnA-to-QnA performs best)

**Application to UMBRELLA**:
- Design simple, consistent prompts for medical report generation
- Avoid complex descriptions that enable template memorization
- Focus on forcing visual feature learning

#### Stepping Stone 2: Regression as Text Generation (Current Gap)

**Current State**: Regression outputs scalars (Age=45.3, MMSE=28)

**UMBRELLA Transformation**:
```python
# Traditional Regression
model_output = 45.3  # age prediction
model_output = 28    # MMSE prediction

# Text Generation Framework
model_output = "This subject is approximately 45 years old"
model_output = "MMSE score is estimated at 28, indicating normal cognition"

# Full UMBRELLA
model_output = """
Based on structural MRI analysis:
- Age: Approximately 45 years based on cortical thickness patterns
- Cognitive Status: MMSE estimated at 28 (normal range)
- Brain Health: Mild white matter changes consistent with age
- Recommendation: Routine follow-up in 2 years
"""
```

**What Needs to Change**:
1. **Loss function**: Cross-entropy for text generation instead of MSE/MAE
2. **Output format**: Token sequences instead of scalars
3. **Training data**: Numbers → text descriptions
4. **Evaluation**: BLEU/ROUGE for text quality, not just R²

#### Stepping Stone 3: Multi-Modal Integration

**Current**: Separate experiments for T1, fMRI
**UMBRELLA Goal**: Unified multi-modal analysis

**Architecture Evolution**:
```
Current Experiments:
T1 MRI → Vision Encoder → Regression Head → Age prediction
fMRI → Vision Encoder → Classification Head → Sex prediction

UMBRELLA Architecture:
T1 MRI → sMRI Tokenizer ──┐
fMRI → fMRI Tokenizer ────┤
dMRI → dMRI Tokenizer ────┤→ Universal Encoder → LLM → Medical Report
Text → Text Tokenizer ────┘
(demographics, captions)
```

**Implementation Path**:
1. Individual modality tokenizers (already have T1, rsfMRI loaders)
2. Universal encoder that projects all modalities to common space
3. LLM that generates reports from unified representations
4. Caption engineering to inject demographics/clinical data

#### Stepping Stone 4: Caption Engineering (Not Yet Started)

**Critical Missing Piece**: Transform structured data → natural language captions

**Current Experiments Use**: Limited text context
```python
# Current (from dataset_T1_LLaVa.py)
quest = "USER: <image>\nYou are a neurologist analyzing T1 MRI..."
ans = 'ASSISTANT: '
```

**UMBRELLA Requires**: Rich captions from all available data
```python
# UMBRELLA captions
subject_caption = f"""
Demographics: {age}-year-old {sex} with {education} years of education
Brain Metrics: Total volume {brain_vol} cm³, Hippocampal volume {hipp_vol} cm³
Cognitive Scores: MMSE {mmse}, Logical Memory {logic_mem}
Medical History: {conditions}
Current Assessment: {clinical_notes}
"""

# Training format
quest = f"USER: <image>\n{subject_caption}\nAnalyze this brain MRI and provide comprehensive assessment."
ans = f"ASSISTANT: {medical_report_text}"
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Extract all available metadata from datasets (GARD, ABCD, UKB)
2. Design caption templates for different information types
3. Integrate captions into dataset loaders
4. Train model to connect visual features + text captions → reports

## Key Research Questions

### 1. Prompt Design Optimization

**Question**: What prompt structure produces best medical reports?

**Hypotheses**:
- Simple, direct prompts > complex CoT prompts (supported by Suin Cho's findings)
- Format consistency (training format = inference format) critical
- Neurologist role-playing may help

**Experiments Needed**:
- Systematic prompt ablation study
- Template memorization detection
- Clinical expert evaluation of generated reports

### 2. Caption Engineering Effectiveness

**Question**: How does caption richness impact model performance?

**Hypotheses**:
- More information in captions → better reports
- But: risk of model ignoring visual features, relying only on text
- Balance needed between visual learning and caption utilization

**Experiments Needed**:
- Ablate caption components (demographics only → + brain metrics → + clinical notes)
- Test model with degraded/missing captions at inference
- Measure attention to visual vs text features

### 3. Multi-Modal Fusion Strategy

**Question**: How to optimally combine T1, fMRI, dMRI?

**Hypotheses**:
- BLIP-2 style (cross-attention) > LLaVA style (concatenation) for multi-modal
- Modality-specific encoders > shared encoder
- Learned fusion weights > fixed combination

**Experiments Needed**:
- Compare fusion architectures
- Ablate individual modalities
- Test if fMRI/dMRI add value beyond sMRI alone

### 4. Vision Encoder Adaptation

**Question**: Can we fine-tune vision encoder without losing natural image performance?

**Hypotheses**:
- Multi-task learning (brain MRI + natural images) prevents catastrophic forgetting
- Very small learning rates for vision encoder safe
- Brain features complementary to natural image features

**Experiments Needed**:
- Fine-tune vision encoder with different strategies
- Monitor ImageNet accuracy during training
- Test transfer to other medical imaging domains

### 5. Regression → Text Generation Trade-offs

**Question**: Does text generation improve over traditional regression?

**Hypotheses**:
- Text generation more flexible (can explain reasoning)
- But: harder to train (sparse signal from language modeling)
- May need more data than regression

**Experiments Needed**:
- Compare regression vs text generation on same tasks
- Measure data efficiency
- Evaluate clinical utility of explanations

## Integration with Broader AI Ecosystem

### Why Language-Centric Multimodal Models Matter

**From Presentation Slide 7**:

1. **Scalability**: As LLM size increases, model performance increases
2. **Modality-Encoder Scaling**: As vision encoder size increases, performance also increases
3. **Language as Universal Interface**: Text generation enables integration with modern AI tools

### Enabling Technologies from UMBRELLA

#### Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
```
Input: "Analyze this brain MRI for MCI diagnosis"

Model Output (with CoT):
"Let me analyze this step by step:
1. Structural features: I observe mild hippocampal atrophy bilaterally
2. Age correlation: At 66 years old, some atrophy is normal but this exceeds age-matched norms
3. Functional connectivity: DMN shows reduced connectivity (0.42 vs normal 0.55)
4. Cognitive scores: MMSE of 27 is borderline (normal >28 for this education level)
5. Conclusion: These findings are consistent with early MCI"
```

#### ReACT (Reasoning + Acting)
```
Agent: "I need to determine if this patient has MCI"
  Action 1: Analyze structural MRI → "Mild hippocampal atrophy detected"
  Thought 1: "Atrophy suggests possible cognitive decline, but need functional evidence"
  Action 2: Analyze fMRI → "DMN connectivity reduced"
  Thought 2: "Consistent with MCI, but should check demographics"
  Action 3: Query caption data → "66 year old with MMSE=27"
  Thought 3: "MMSE borderline for age, combined evidence supports MCI"
  Final Answer: "Diagnosis: Early MCI with 75% confidence"
```

#### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
```
Model sees MRI → generates initial impression → retrieves similar cases from database
  ↓
"This pattern is similar to 15 previously diagnosed MCI cases
in our database (average hippocampal volume 3.1 cm³ vs 3.2 cm³ observed)"
  ↓
Refined diagnosis with evidence-based support
```

#### Multi-Agent Systems
```
Structural MRI Agent: "I see hippocampal atrophy"
Functional MRI Agent: "I see reduced DMN connectivity"
Cognitive Assessment Agent: "MMSE=27 is borderline"
Clinical Integrator Agent: "Combining all evidence → MCI diagnosis"
  ↓
Debate and consensus → Final medical report
```

**The Power**: Once neuroimaging speaks the language of text, it can participate in ALL modern AI agent workflows.

## Conclusion: The UMBRELLA Vision

BrainVLM (UMBRELLA) is **not incremental improvement on neuroimaging analysis** - it's a **fundamental transformation** of how we approach brain MRI interpretation:

**From**: Neuroimaging as isolated prediction tasks
**To**: Neuroimaging as a participant in language-centric AI ecosystems

**From**: Scalar outputs (age=45, MMSE=28)
**To**: Rich medical reports with reasoning and context

**From**: "We don't know how to describe MRI"
**To**: Caption engineering transforms all available data into language

**From**: Frozen components limiting performance
**To**: Strategic two-step training preserves pre-training while adapting to neuroscience

**The Ultimate Goal**: When a neuroimaging scan can generate a medical report in natural language, it can participate in Chain-of-Thought reasoning, ReACT agent workflows, RAG-enhanced diagnosis, and multi-agent clinical decision systems. This bridges the 50-year gap between neuroimaging technology and modern AI.

**Current Status**: We have the foundation (prompt design insights, architecture comparisons, training strategies). The path forward is clear: caption engineering, projector unfreezing, multi-modal integration, and text generation implementation.

**Timeline**: 6 months to basic text generation, 12 months to clinical-grade reports, 18-24 months to full AI agent integration.

**Impact**: Democratizes neuroimaging expertise, improves diagnostic accuracy, enables AI-assisted neurology, and establishes neuroimaging as a first-class modality in the age of large language models.

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Next Update**: After Phase 1 milestones (projector unfreezing, caption engineering v1)
**Status**: Living Document - Will evolve as UMBRELLA develops
