### B. Critical Insights About fMRI Foundation Models

**Finding 1: Pretraining Objective Matters Fundamentally**
- Reconstruction-based (MAE/SimMIM) less suitable for noisy fMRI
- Representation-level (JEPA-style) outperforms by 2-3%
- This is not marginal—reflects fundamental mismatch between SNR and pixel-level targets
- **Implication**: Future work should prioritize JEPA-style approaches

**Finding 2: Data Diversity > Data Scale**
- BrainLM (40K hours, single source) vs. Brain-JEPA (3K hours, mixed sources): JEPA comparable/better
- Multi-dataset pretraining (UKB+ABCD+HCP) improves generalization despite smaller total scale
- **Implication**: Strategic curation more important than raw quantity

**Finding 3: Temporal Dynamics Underexplored**
- Current approaches preserve temporal resolution but don't optimize for temporal coherence
- BOLD has ~2-3 second autocorrelation; this carries diagnostic information
- Brain-JEPA's spatiotemporal masking is partial solution
- **Implication**: Specialized temporal components (RNNs, dilated convolutions, attention over time) remain to be explored

**Finding 4: Architectural Saturation Near 800M Parameters**
- 200M → 800M: clear performance gains
- 800M → 3.2B: diminishing returns
- Suggests current approaches have hit theoretical limits at moderate scale
- **Implication**: Future improvements come from objective/architecture innovation, not just scaling

**Finding 5: Clinical Translation Bottleneck**
- Research-grade accuracy (70-78%) insufficient for clinical deployment (~85% required)
- Uncertainty quantification missing in all current approaches
- Interpretability (why this prediction?) critical but underdeveloped
- **Implication**: Path to clinical use requires safety/explainability work alongside accuracy improvements

### C. SwiFT v2 Position in Landscape

#### Strengths
✅ **Computational Efficiency**: 3-5 days on 8-16 A100s (accessible for most labs)
✅ **Architectural Clarity**: Easy to understand, modify, debug (research-friendly)
✅ **Multi-dataset Strategy**: Diversity approach novel and effective (good generalization)
✅ **Systematic Characterization**: Scaling curves, few-shot analysis provide reference
✅ **Implementation Maturity**: Production-ready codebase, reproducible
✅ **Modular Design**: Components can be swapped (e.g., pretraining objective)

#### Limitations
❌ **Performance Gap**: 70-73% vs. 76-78% (Brain-JEPA), 2-5% behind state-of-the-art
❌ **Suboptimal Pretraining**: SimMIM theoretically inferior to JEPA for noisy data
❌ **Temporal Modeling**: No optimization for temporal coherence, random masking
❌ **Unimodal Design**: Ignores motion, physiology signals (~0.5-1% accuracy)
❌ **No Uncertainty**: Missing confidence intervals, critical for clinical use

#### Strategic Positioning
- **Not**: State-of-the-art, theoretically optimal, clinical deployment ready
- **Is**: Efficient baseline, research platform, foundation for improvements, systematic benchmark

#### Unique Value Proposition
SwiFT v2 trades some performance for:
1. **Accessibility**: Can run on limited computational resources
2. **Modularity**: Easy to test improvements (e.g., JEPA-style pretraining)
3. **Interpretability**: Reconstruction targets are visible, enabling debugging
4. **Community Service**: Provides reference baseline for reproducible comparisons

## III. Strategic Recommendations

### Short-Term Improvements (1-2 months)

**Recommendation 1: Adopt Brain-JEPA Style Pretraining**
- Implement representation-level predictive learning
- Expected gain: +2-3% accuracy (70-73% → 72-76%)
- Keep SwiFT v2 architecture (temporal-spatial asymmetry)
- Hybrid approach: BrainJEPA's objective + SwiFT's efficiency
- **Effort**: Moderate (new predictor network component)

**Recommendation 2: Implement Spatiotemporal Masking**
- Mask patches considering temporal coherence
- Account for BOLD autocorrelation (~2-3 second window)
- Don't mask entire temporal sequence at once
- Expected gain: +1-2% accuracy
- **Effort**: Low-moderate (modified masking strategy)

**Recommendation 3: Add Physiological Signals**
- Incorporate motion (already computed during preprocessing)
- Add heart rate (present in some datasets)
- Expected gain: +0.5-1% accuracy, +3-5% few-shot performance
- **Effort**: Moderate (data integration, architecture modification)

**Combined Potential**: 70-73% → ~75-76% (approaching Brain-JEPA range)

### Medium-Term Directions (2-4 months)

**Recommendation 4: Clinical Validation Framework**
- Systematic comparison against clinical standards
- Uncertainty quantification (confidence intervals)
- Calibration analysis (prediction confidence vs. accuracy)
- Adversarial robustness testing
- **Rationale**: Path to eventual clinical adoption

**Recommendation 5: Interpretability Analysis**
- Attention visualization (what brain regions does model attend to?)
- Saliency maps (which voxels/timesteps drive predictions?)
- Layer-wise analysis (feature progression through model)
- **Rationale**: Understand *why* predictions are made

**Recommendation 6: Fine-grained Scaling Study**
- Clarify scale vs. diversity trade-off
- Test model scales beyond 3.2B
- Examine cross-dataset transfer (pretrain on UKB, test on ABCD)
- **Rationale**: Establish theoretical understanding

### Long-Term Research Directions (4-12 months)

**Recommendation 7: Architectural Innovation**
- Test non-transformer architectures (GNNs, RNNs, hybrids)
- Design specifically for fMRI characteristics (not borrowed from vision)
- Explore biological constraints (brain parcellation, connectivity)
- **Rationale**: Current transformers may not be optimal for neuroimaging

**Recommendation 8: Novel Pretraining Objectives**
- Self-supervised behavioral prediction (fMRI → IQ, personality, etc.)
- Contrastive learning on brain states
- Temporal coherence optimization
- **Rationale**: Direct optimization for downstream applicability

**Recommendation 9: Subject-Adaptive Models**
- Personalized models accounting for individual variation
- Continual learning (model updates as new scans acquired)
- Few-shot adaptation (new subject, rapid personalization)
- **Rationale**: Brain organization differs substantially between individuals
