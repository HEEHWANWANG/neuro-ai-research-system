# Vector Database - START HERE

## üéØ What Happened

You asked: **"Save all documents to vector database"**

‚úÖ **Done!** All 16 research documents have been saved to a **SQLite vector database** with zero external dependencies.

---

## üìç Where Is It?

```
.claude/workspace/memory/research_vectordb.db
```

That's a single 284 KB SQLite file containing all your research documents, fully searchable.

---

## üöÄ How to Use (Simple Version)

```python
from simple_vectordb import SimpleVectorDB

# Open database
db = SimpleVectorDB(".claude/workspace/memory/research_vectordb.db")

# Search for documents
results = db.search("foundation models")

# Get the first result
if results:
    doc = results[0]
    print(doc['metadata']['filename'])  # Which document
    print(doc['content'][:500])          # First 500 chars

# Close when done
db.close()
```

---

## üìö What's Saved

**16 documents (206.15 KB total)**

### ‚≠ê Most Important (Use These!)
1. **SwiFT_v2_Introduction_Critical_Review_and_Revision.md** (27.8 KB)
