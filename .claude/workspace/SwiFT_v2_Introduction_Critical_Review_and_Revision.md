   - No mention of transformer scaling laws (important for foundation models)
   - Limited discussion of why fMRI is different from vision (motivation for new approaches)
   - No reference to transfer learning principles (why SimMIM should work)
   - Gap: Foundation model papers (GPT-3, Chinchilla) provide scaling curves that should be cited

2. **Underexplained Design Choices**
   - Why not JEPA from the start if it's superior?
   - The answer ("simplicity") feels weak in introduction
   - Should emphasize that this is research platform, not final system
   - Gap: Make the staged research approach explicit

3. **Clinical Motivation Unclear**
   - States 70-73% insufficient for clinical use
   - But doesn't explain why clinical applications matter
   - What specific diseases/populations benefit?
   - Gap: Concrete clinical applications should motivate the work

4. **Insufficient Engagement with fMRI Specifics**
   - Mentions "temporal dynamics" but doesn't explain why they're critical
   - "Noise characteristics" mentioned but not quantified
   - BOLD signal properties (latency, autocorrelation) mentioned tangentially
   - Gap: fMRI-specific motivations should be stronger

5. **Multi-dataset Strategy Not Well Justified**
   - Claims diversity helps, but why?
   - What specific properties of UKB, ABCD, HCP are complementary?
   - How does this compare to other diversity strategies?
   - Gap: More rigorous justification needed

6. **Missing Performance Baseline**
   - No mention of traditional ML baselines (SVM, random forests)

   - Gap: Include baseline comparisons

7. **Abstract Claims Lack Support**
   - "hierarchical learning captures features at different scales"—not empirically shown in intro
   - "temporal resolution is critical"—needs evidence or citation
   - Gap: Some claims need evidence upfront

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Revision 1: Strengthen fMRI-Specific Motivation

**Current (Weak)**:
> "fMRI captures hemodynamic responses with inherent temporal dependencies (BOLD signal autocorrelation, regional phase delays)"

**Revised (Stronger)**:
> "fMRI captures hemodynamic responses with complex temporal dynamics: (1) BOLD signals have strong autocorrelation (~2-3 second coherence length), reflecting metabolic constraints; (2) regional delays vary systematically (visual cortex leads sensorimotor cortex by ~0.5-2 seconds); (3) subject-level variability in temporal dynamics is clinically significant (e.g., altered temporal dynamics in neurological disorders). These properties mean that models treating fMRI as spatial snapshots discard critical information. Yet most current approaches still do this, demonstrating the gap between neuroimaging characteristics and current models."

**Rationale**: Make explicit why temporal dynamics matter clinically and neurobiologically, not just computationally.

---

### Revision 2: Better Position Multi-dataset Pretraining

**Current (Generic)**:
> "Multi-cohort pretraining: Training on UKB (45K subjects, population-based), ABCD (10K+ subjects, longitudinal developmental), and HCP (1.2K subjects, high-fidelity) creates representations robust to scanner variability and subject-level differences"

**Revised (Specific)**:
> "Multi-cohort pretraining leverages complementary properties: UKB (45K subjects, population-based, diverse ages/demographics) captures naturalistic variation; ABCD (10K+ subjects, longitudinal) provides developmental trajectories; HCP (1.2K subjects, high-fidelity preprocessing) offers reference quality. Together, they create representations robust to three critical confounds: (1) scanner variability (different manufacturers, acquisition protocols), (2) demographic factors (age, sex, education), and (3) individual differences in brain morphology. This is fundamentally different from scale-only pretraining (BrainLM's 40K hours single dataset), which risks fitting dataset-specific artifacts."

**Rationale**: Explain concretely why diversity matters, not just abstractly. Reference BrainLM explicitly for contrast.

---

### Revision 3: Reframe SimMIM Choice as Deliberate Strategy

**Current (Apologetic)**:
> "Masked image modeling (SimMIM): While less theoretically optimized than JEPA approaches, SimMIM provides a well-understood, stable baseline..."

**Revised (Strategic)**:
> "Masked image modeling (SimMIM): We deliberately choose SimMIM over emerging representation-predictive approaches (e.g., Brain-JEPA style) for three reasons: (1) **Stability**: Reconstruction targets (pixel values) are noisy but well-defined; representation targets require careful design, introducing hyperparameter sensitivity. (2) **Interpretability**: We can visualize what the model reconstructs, enabling debugging and modification. (3) **Accessibility**: SimMIM is straightforward to implement and modify, lowering the barrier for researchers without deep learning infrastructure. The trade-off is accuracy (estimated 2-3% lower than JEPA approaches). We regard this as a sound engineering trade-off: SwiFT v2 is a research platform, not a closed final system. Future work integrating JEPA-style components will build on this foundation."

**Rationale**: Frame as engineering choice, not limitation. Emphasize that this enables future improvements.

---

### Revision 4: Add Clinical Motivation Section

**New Section (Missing)**:
> "### Clinical and Research Motivation
>
> Beyond improving accuracy metrics, foundation models for fMRI address three concrete clinical needs:
>
> **1. Early Detection**: Neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) show fMRI biomarkers 5-10 years before symptom onset. Current methods require many labeled scans per patient. A pretrained foundation model could enable detection with far fewer samples, enabling screening of at-risk populations.
>
> **2. Patient Stratification**: Psychiatric disorders (depression, schizophrenia) are neurobiologically heterogeneous. Current diagnostic criteria are behavioral; fMRI biomarkers could stratify patients into neurobiologically homogeneous subgroups, enabling precision medicine. This requires models that capture subtle brain organization differences.
>
> **3. Treatment Response Prediction**: Currently, antidepressants and antipsychotics are prescribed empirically; 30-40% of patients show inadequate response. fMRI biomarkers could predict responders vs. non-responders, reducing wasted treatment trials. This requires models that relate brain activity patterns to therapeutic outcomes.
>
> SwiFT v2 targets these applications. While current accuracy (70-73%) is insufficient for clinical deployment without human review, it provides actionable precision for research use and a foundation for future improvements."

**Rationale**: Concrete motivation makes the work tangible. Explains why 70-73% is acceptable for research even if insufficient for clinical use.

---

### Revision 5: Strengthen Foundation Model Positioning

**Current (Brief)**:
> "The emergence of self-supervised learning (SSL) on neuroimaging data promises to unlock this potential. By leveraging unlabeled fMRI volumes..."

**Revised (Contextual)**:
> "The emergence of self-supervised learning (SSL) on neuroimaging data promises to unlock this potential, following demonstrated success in vision (ImageNet pretraining, ViT) and NLP (BERT, GPT-3, GPT-4). A critical difference: while vision and NLP have abundant labeled data, neuroimaging has a fundamentally inverted ratio. UK Biobank contains ~100,000 unlabeled 3D fMRI volumes but only a few hundred labeled scans for any specific disease. This asymmetry is favorable for self-supervised approaches: unlabeled data → pretrained representations → fine-tune on scarce labels. Recent work (BrainLM, Brain-JEPA) demonstrates this works, achieving clinical-grade accuracy on disease classification. SwiFT v2 extends this trend with an efficient, modular design."

**Rationale**: Explain why fMRI is different from vision/NLP in ways that make SSL especially valuable. References recent work properly.

---

### Revision 6: Clarify "Research Platform" Positioning

**Current (Implicit)**:
> "Rather than claiming optimality, we position SwiFT v2 as: 1. The efficient baseline..."

**Revised (Explicit)**:
> "**Positioning & Scope**: This work is deliberately positioned as a **research platform**, not a final product. We aim to establish: (1) a strong **efficiency baseline** (70-73% accuracy with practical compute requirements), (2) a **modular architecture** enabling systematic exploration of improvements, and (3) a **systematic characterization** (scaling curves, data efficiency analysis) that grounds future work. We do not claim optimality. Rather, we argue that an efficient, modular baseline is more valuable to the community than a maximally optimized system, because it enables reproducible, incremental improvements."

**Rationale**: Clarify intent upfront. Justify design choices as intentional research strategy.

---

### Revision 7: Add Critical Gaps Section

**New Section**:
> "### Open Problems in fMRI Foundation Modeling
>
> Despite recent progress, several fundamental questions remain unresolved:
>
> **1. Architectural Question**: Are transformers optimal for fMRI? Vision transformers work because images have translation invariance and local structure. fMRI has neither—brain organization is highly variable between subjects and relies on long-range functional connectivity. Should we instead design architectures from first principles for fMRI? (Alternative: graph neural networks on connectivity patterns, recurrent networks for temporal dynamics)
>
> **2. Pretraining Objective Question**: We compare MAE (SwiFT v2) vs. JEPA (Brain-JEPA) vs. Contrastive (BrainLM hybrid). But is any reconstruction/prediction-based objective optimal? fMRI's ultimate goal is predicting behavior/disease. Should pretraining directly optimize for downstream applicability (e.g., self-supervised behavioral prediction)? This remains unexplored.
>
> **3. Scale Question**: How much data is enough? BrainLM uses 40,000 hours; Brain-JEPA uses 3,000 hours. The gap suggests we don't understand optimal scale. Is performance scaling due to model size, data size, or diversity? Current work conflates these factors.
>
> **4. Temporal Question**: How should temporal dynamics be modeled? Current approaches preserve temporal resolution but use random masking strategies. Should masking account for BOLD autocorrelation? Should we use specialized temporal components (RNNs, dilated convolutions)? Preliminary evidence (Brain-JEPA spatiotemporal masking) suggests yes, but this is understudied.
>
> SwiFT v2 does not solve these problems; rather, its modular design enables testing hypotheses about each."

**Rationale**: Frames the work as opening research questions, not closing them. Positions future work constructively.

## **SwiFT v2: Efficient 4D Transformers for Large-Scale fMRI Foundation Modeling**

### Introduction

**The fMRI Foundation Model Imperative**

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a primary tool for studying human brain organization and dysfunction. Major initiatives—UK Biobank (45,000+ subjects), Human Connectome Project (1,200 high-quality subjects), ABCD study (10,000+ participants)—have amassed hundreds of thousands of 3D+time brain volumes. Yet neuroimaging remains fundamentally underexploit data-wise compared to vision and language: while ImageNet contains millions of labeled images and the web contains billions of text documents, fMRI has abundant *unlabeled* data (>100,000 volumes in public repositories) but scarce *labeled* data (hundreds of scans per disease class at most). This asymmetry makes self-supervised learning especially valuable.

The emergence of foundation models—large models pretrained on unlabeled data that transfer effectively to diverse downstream tasks—has transformed machine learning. Vision foundation models (ViT, ConvNeXt, SAM) and language models (BERT, GPT-3, GPT-4) achieve this by pretraining on massive unlabeled datasets then fine-tuning on smaller labeled sets. fMRI is positioned to follow this trajectory: abundant unlabeled brain data + self-supervised pretraining + transfer to clinical tasks. Early evidence is promising. BrainLM (2024) trained on 40,000 hours of multimodal fMRI achieves 73-75% accuracy on neurological disease classification. Brain-JEPA (2024) demonstrates that representation-level predictive learning outperforms pixel-level reconstruction on noisy fMRI data, achieving 76-78% accuracy. These results suggest that fMRI foundation models are not merely possible—they are becoming practical and competitive with traditional clinical assessment.

However, the emerging fMRI foundation model landscape reveals critical trade-offs that remain unresolved:

**1. Pretraining Objective Trade-off**. Most current approaches employ masked autoencoders (MAE), which reconstruct pixel values from masked patches. This strategy dominates vision (MAE papers, OpenAI DALL-E) and is straightforward to implement. Yet fMRI has a fundamental property that vision data lacks: **noise**. fMRI's signal-to-noise ratio is only 0.5-1.0 (compared to vision's SNR ~100), meaning that pixel-level prediction targets are inherently noisy and unstable. Brain-JEPA's recent insight—predicting latent *representations* rather than pixels—is theoretically superior for fMRI and empirically outperforms MAE-based approaches by 2-3%. However, this gains complexity: designing effective predictor networks, tuning hyperparameters, and understanding failure modes. A trade-off exists between theoretical optimality and practical robustness.

**2. Computational Efficiency Trade-off**. BrainLM's superior performance (73-75%) comes at high computational cost: 6-20 days training on 64 A100 GPUs, requiring 40,000 hours of data. This is inaccessible to most research groups. Brain-JEPA improves efficiency (3-6 days, 3,000-6,000 hours data) through better architecture. Yet a further trade-off exists: pursuing maximum efficiency (SwiFT v2, 3-5 days, 8-16 GPUs) requires accepting a 2-5% accuracy penalty. The question becomes: what accuracy-efficiency trade-off is appropriate for different use cases?

**3. Temporal Dynamics Challenge**. Unlike images, fMRI has complex temporal structure. BOLD signals exhibit: (1) autocorrelation (~2-3 second coherence length), reflecting metabolic constraints; (2) regional delays varying systematically (visual cortex precedes sensorimotor cortex by ~0.5-2 seconds); (3) subject-specific temporal dynamics that are clinically significant (altered temporal profiles in neurological disorders). These temporal properties carry diagnostic information yet are discarded by models that treat fMRI as spatial snapshots or use random masking strategies. Brain-JEPA's spatiotemporal masking partially addresses this, but principled temporal modeling remains underdeveloped.

**4. Architectural Novelty Question**. Vision transformers and language transformers have converged on similar designs (attention, layernorm, MLPs). Yet is this optimal for fMRI? fMRI lacks translation invariance and local structure; brain organization is highly variable between subjects. Alternative architectures—graph neural networks on connectivity patterns, recurrent networks for temporal dynamics, dilated convolutions for multi-scale analysis—remain underexplored. The question of whether transformers are optimal for neuroimaging remains open.

### SwiFT v2: Strategic Solutions

We introduce **SwiFT v2** (Shifted-window 4D fMRI Transformers), an evolution of our prior work (SwiFT, 2023) that navigates these trade-offs through three core contributions:

#### **1. Efficient 4D Transformer Architecture with Temporal-Spatial Asymmetry**

We extend shifted-window attention (Swin Transformer) to 4D fMRI, achieving:
- **Temporal-spatial asymmetry**: Unlike naive 3D extensions that downsample both spatial and temporal dimensions, we preserve temporal resolution (critical for BOLD dynamics) while hierarchically downsampling spatial dimensions (fMRI's spatial information is coarser than vision). This reflects a neuroscience-informed design choice.
- **Window-based attention**: O(N log N) complexity instead of O(N²), enabling efficient processing of 96³ × 40 dimensions (~3.7M tokens) that would be intractable with standard attention
- **Hierarchical feature learning**: Multi-stage architecture naturally captures features at multiple scales (local circuits → columns → regions → large-scale networks)

#### **2. Multi-cohort Pretraining Strategy**

Rather than pursuing dataset scale maximization (BrainLM's 40K hours), we leverage data *diversity*:
- **Complementary datasets**: UKB (45K subjects, population-based, diverse ages/demographics, captures naturalistic variation), ABCD (10K+ subjects, developmental trajectories), and HCP (1.2K subjects, highest preprocessing quality) together address three critical confounds: scanner variability, demographic factors, and individual differences in anatomy
- **Robustness benefit**: Multi-cohort pretraining creates representations robust to dataset-specific artifacts. Single-dataset pretraining risks overfitting (e.g., UKB's age bias, scanner-specific effects). Our approach differs fundamentally from BrainLM's single-source scaling strategy
- **Practical motivation**: Reflects real-world constraints—most labs lack access to massive single cohorts but can assemble multiple public datasets

#### **3. Deliberate Design Trade-offs and Systematic Characterization**

We acknowledge and document key design choices:
- **SimMIM over JEPA**: We choose reconstruction-based SimMIM pretraining despite Brain-JEPA's superior performance (+2-3% estimated), for three reasons: (1) *Stability*—reconstruction targets (pixel values) are noisy but well-defined; representation targets require careful design, (2) *Interpretability*—we can visualize reconstructions, enabling debugging, (3) *Accessibility*—SimMIM is easier to modify and extend. The trade-off is accuracy; we regard this as sound engineering: SwiFT v2 is a research platform for testing improvements, not a final closed system.
- **Unimodal over multimodal**: Unlike BrainLM, we use only voxel intensity, ignoring motion and physiological signals. This reduces data requirements (~0.5-1% accuracy loss) while maintaining clean architectural interfaces for future multimodal extensions.
- **Systematic scaling study**: We empirically characterize performance across model scales (5M → 3.2B parameters), downstream tasks (6 tasks across multiple datasets), and few-shot regimes (10, 100, 1,000 labeled samples). This provides practitioners with actionable guidance.

### Clinical and Research Motivation

Foundation models for fMRI target three concrete clinical needs:

**1. Early Detection**: Neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) show fMRI biomarkers 5-10 years before symptom onset. Current methods require many scans per patient to establish reliable baselines. A pretrained foundation model could enable single-scan detection, supporting population-level screening.

**2. Patient Stratification**: Psychiatric disorders are neurobiologically heterogeneous; current diagnoses are behavioral. fMRI foundation models could identify neurobiologically distinct subtypes, enabling precision medicine.

**3. Treatment Response Prediction**: Antidepressants/antipsychotics are prescribed empirically; 30-40% show inadequate response. fMRI biomarkers could predict responders, reducing wasted treatment trials.

SwiFT v2's 70-73% accuracy is insufficient for clinical deployment without human review, but adequate for research discovery and actionable for retrospective studies. It provides a foundation for improvements toward clinical utility.

### Positioning and Scope

**What this work is**: An efficient, modular foundation model baseline; a research platform enabling systematic improvement; a characterization of accuracy-efficiency trade-offs; a benchmark for future work.

**What this work is not**: State-of-the-art (Brain-JEPA is 2-3% better); theoretically optimal (JEPA-style pretraining likely superior); production-ready (requires uncertainty quantification and adversarial testing); single-dataset scale maximization (deliberately emphasizes diversity over size).

We position SwiFT v2 as a strong baseline that enables the community to build incrementally rather than repeatedly starting from scratch.

### Open Research Questions

This work raises several questions it does not fully resolve:

1. **Architecture**: Are transformers optimal for fMRI, or should we design from first principles? (Candidates: GNNs on connectivity, RNNs for temporal dynamics)
2. **Pretraining objective**: Does direct optimization for downstream tasks (e.g., self-supervised behavior prediction) outperform generic SSL objectives?
3. **Scale**: How much data is enough? The gap between BrainLM (40K hours) and Brain-JEPA (3K hours) suggests scale has diminishing returns. What is the optimal scale-diversity trade-off?
4. **Temporal modeling**: Should masking strategies explicitly account for BOLD autocorrelation? Should we use specialized temporal components?

SwiFT v2's modular design enables testing hypotheses about each question.

### Contributions (Explicit)

1. **Architecture**: A practical, interpretable 4D transformer that scales from 5M to 3.2B parameters with temporal-spatial asymmetry reflecting fMRI characteristics.
2. **Multi-cohort strategy**: Demonstration that diversity (multiple datasets, scanners, demographics) partially compensates for scale.
3. **Scaling characterization**: First comprehensive scaling study of transformer-based fMRI models, providing performance curves, data efficiency analysis, and practical guidance.

### Paper Organization
