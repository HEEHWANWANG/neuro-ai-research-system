## 💡 Key Insights for Development

### Architectural Design Principles
- **Locality matters**: Shifted-window attention is efficient and works
- **Temporal is critical**: Don't merge temporal dimension like spatial
- **Hierarchical learning**: Multi-stage processing captures features at scales
- **4D is necessary**: Can't just treat as stacked 3D volumes

### Training Strategy
- **Self-supervised is powerful**: Pretraining improves most downstream tasks
- **Multi-dataset helps**: Diverse pretraining → better generalization
- **Scale matters, but saturates**: ~800M parameters sweet spot
- **Few-shot possible**: Works with small labeled datasets

### Transfer Learning
- **One model, many tasks**: Single pretrained backbone for multiple tasks
- **Task-specific heads**: Lightweight task-specific modules
- **Efficient fine-tuning**: Freeze backbone or partial fine-tuning
- **Cross-domain transfer**: Pretrained on UKB, applies to ABCD, HCP
