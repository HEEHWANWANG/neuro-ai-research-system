## Key Insights & Design Decisions

### 1. **Project Organization Philosophy**
**Decision**: Manage Brain-JEPA and BrainLM as separate external projects with documentation in neuro-ai-research-system

**Rationale**:
- Preserves original project independence
- Facilitates independent updates and maintenance
- Clear separation for comparison and analysis
- Easier to cite and reference in manuscript

**Documentation Strategy**:
- Created `.claude/benchmarks/` as central knowledge base
- Cross-referenced to external project locations
- All analysis and framework centralized for comparison

### 2. **Three-Layer Organization**
**Layers**:
1. Documentation & Analysis (knowledge base)
2. Code Repositories (implementation)
3. Results & Artifacts (outputs)

**Benefit**: Clear separation of concerns, easy navigation, supports different user roles

### 3. **Fixed Random Seed Strategy**
**Decision**: Use seed=42 for all train/val/test splits

**Benefit**: Complete reproducibility across all evaluations, comparison validity

### 4. **Dataset Priority**
**Primary**: ADNI (Alzheimer's disease classification)
- Reason: Both models evaluated on ADNI, enables direct comparison
- Task: 3-way classification (NC/MCI/AD)

**Secondary**: HCP-Aging (healthy aging)
- Reason: Out-of-distribution test, shows transfer to healthy population
- Task: Binary sex classification

### 5. **Comprehensive Metrics**
**Decision**: Compute 13 metrics across 3 categories:
- Performance (5 metrics)
- Efficiency (4 metrics)
- Representation (4 metrics)

**Benefit**: Holistic comparison addressing multiple aspects of model quality

### 6. **Six-Phase Workflow**
**Design**: Sequential phases with optional parallelization

**Phases**:
1. Setup & Data Preparation (critical path)
2. Brain-JEPA Evaluation (parallelizable with phase 3)
3. BrainLM Evaluation (parallelizable with phase 2)
4. SwiFT_v2 Evaluation (sequential after 2+3)
5. Analysis & Comparison (sequential after 4)
6. Manuscript Integration (sequential after 5)

**Total Estimated Duration**: 9-15 days
