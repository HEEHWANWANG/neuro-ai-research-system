# Hypothesis Engine Coordinator ðŸ’¡

Orchestrate Generate â†’ Debate â†’ Evolve loops for scientific hypotheses informed by systematic academic literature search.

## Agents: @neurolit-agent, @ai-trend-agent, @reflection-agent, @ranking-agent, @evolution-agent, @meta-review-agent

## Academic Search Integration

All agents in the Hypothesis Engine Pod are now mandated to proactively use academic literature MCPs:

### Primary Searchers
- **@neurolit-agent**: PubMed + Google Scholar
  - Literature survey for hypothesis foundation
  - Research gaps identification
  - Clinical applicability assessment

- **@ai-trend-agent**: arXiv + Google Scholar
  - Cutting-edge AI/ML techniques
  - Foundation models and architectures
  - Latest innovations (1-2 years)

### Validation Searchers
- **@reflection-agent**: PubMed + arXiv + Google Scholar
  - Hypothesis feasibility verification
  - Literature-backed critiques
  - Comparative analysis with published work

### Ranking Searchers
- **@ranking-agent**: Google Scholar + PubMed
  - Citation impact metrics
  - Evidence-based debate support
  - Clinical validation status

### Evolution Searchers
- **@evolution-agent**: arXiv + PubMed
  - Improved techniques from recent papers
  - Successful simplification strategies
  - Novel combinations of published methods

### Synthesis Searchers
- **@meta-review-agent**: All three MCPs
  - State-of-the-art synthesis
  - Literature pattern identification
  - Emerging trends and opportunities

## Evidence-Based Process

1. **Parallel Literature Review** (neuro + AI)
   - @neurolit-agent: Searches PubMed + Google Scholar
   - @ai-trend-agent: Searches arXiv + Google Scholar
   - Both request Supervisor Agent to execute searches

2. **Literature-Informed Hypothesis Generation**
   - Hypotheses grounded in reviewed literature
   - All claims backed by papers
   - Novelty assessed against published work

3. **Critical Reflection** (Evidence-Based)
   - @reflection-agent: Verifies claims via PubMed + arXiv + Google Scholar
   - Feasibility assessed using literature validation
   - Peer review standard applied

4. **Evidence-Supported Tournament Debates**
   - @ranking-agent: Uses Google Scholar + PubMed for evidence
   - Citation metrics inform rankings
   - Clinical validation considered
   - Elo ratings paired with evidence confidence

5. **Literature-Informed Evolution**
   - @evolution-agent: Searches arXiv + PubMed for improvements
   - Evolved hypotheses cite supporting papers
   - Simplification strategies validated in literature

6. **Iterate Until Convergence**
   - Each generation: quality improves, evidence strengthens
   - Citations and validation increase
   - Consensus emerges on best approaches

7. **Evidence-Grounded Meta-Review**
   - @meta-review-agent: Synthesizes all literature
   - Final report: Publication-ready with citations
   - Implementation roadmap: Evidence-backed steps

## Supervisor Agent Coordination

All agents **request** academic literature searches from Supervisor Agent:
- Agents formulate precise search queries
- Supervisor Agent executes PubMed/ArXiv/Google Scholar searches
- Agents analyze results and cite papers
- ReAct pattern maintained throughout

## Output

- Primary: `.claude/workspace/hypotheses/research_overview.md`
  - Publication-ready research overview
  - Top 3 evolved hypotheses with evidence
  - Complete bibliography
  - Implementation roadmap

- Supporting: All generation files with citations
  - Each hypothesis: Literature references
  - Each critique: Paper evidence
  - Each debate: Citation analysis
  - Each evolution: Source papers

## Critical Success Factors

- **Mandatory Literature Use**: All agents MUST use academic MCPs
- **Citation Completeness**: Every claim backed by papers
- **Evidence Transparency**: All searches documented
- **Academic Rigor**: Top-tier journal standards
- **Reproducibility**: Complete paper trails maintained
