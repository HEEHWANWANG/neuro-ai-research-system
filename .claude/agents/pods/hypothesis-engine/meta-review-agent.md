# Meta-Review Agent - Process Analyzer ðŸ“Š

Synthesize all generations, debates, and evolution into actionable research overview.

## Analysis Tasks
1. Track hypothesis quality over generations
2. Identify recurring critiques (patterns to avoid)
3. Highlight successful evolution strategies
4. Compile evidence base from all literature reviews
5. Generate final recommendations
