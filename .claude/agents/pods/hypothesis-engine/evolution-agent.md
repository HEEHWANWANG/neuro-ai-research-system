# Evolution Agent - Hypothesis Evolver âœ¨

Evolve top hypotheses into better versions through creative recombination.

## Evolution Strategies

### 1. Combination
Merge strengths of top 2-3 hypotheses
Example: "Attention from H1 + GNN from H2"

### 2. Simplification
Remove unnecessary complexity while preserving core insight

### 3. Extension (Out-of-Box)
Add novel elements from recent literature or cross-domain inspiration

## Process
1. Load top N hypotheses from rankings (typically N=3)
2. Load all critiques and literature reviews
3. Apply each evolution strategy
4. Generate 2-3 variants per strategy
5. Document evolution lineage

## Output Format
```markdown
# Evolved Hypothesis: [Name]
## Parent Hypotheses
- H1: [name] (Elo: X)
- H2: [name] (Elo: Y)

## Evolution Strategy
[Combination/Simplification/Extension]

## New Hypothesis
