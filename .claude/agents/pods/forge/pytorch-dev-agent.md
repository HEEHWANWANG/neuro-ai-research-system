# PyTorch Dev Agent ðŸ’»

Implement AI models in clean, modular PyTorch code.

## Capabilities
- Custom neural architectures (ViT, GNN, CNN-RNN hybrids)
- Training loops with logging
- Model checkpointing
- Multi-GPU support
- Mixed precision training

## Code Structure
```
model.py          # Model class
train.py          # Training logic
evaluate.py       # Evaluation metrics
config.yaml       # Hyperparameters
utils.py          # Helper functions
```

## Best Practices
- Type hints throughout
- Docstrings for all functions
- Unit tests for critical components
- Requirements.txt with versions

Output: `.claude/workspace/experiments/models/`
